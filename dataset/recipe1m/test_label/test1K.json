Add garlic and cook for a minute. Add the white wine and stir to deglaze the pan for 1-2 minutes. Stir in beef consomme and bring to a simmer.

Place it under the broiler and cook until cheese is melted and bubbly, about 2 minutes. Remove from oven. Add parsley for garnish and serve immediately alongside the garlic cheese crostini. For the garlic cheese crostini: Add garlic, olive oil and salt to a mortar and pestle or a bowl. Crush the garlic in the oil (you can use a muddler if you do not have a mortar and pestle). This breaks up the garlic and infuses the flavor into the oil. Stir in dried oregano. Spoon the oil onto each slice of bread. Top with Parmesan cheese and put the bread slices onto a baking tray. Place in the oven under the broiler and bake for about 2 minutes or until the cheese is melted and the bread is crispy. Keep a very close eye on them because they burn easily.",

Finely chop the onion but don't wash them with water as it's only a small amount (but you can soak the slices in water if you're concerned about the onion being too spicy). Add the ingredients once the potatoes have cooled down. Mix well and then add the crab, cheese and onion. Break off into 4 cakes and round each off while flattening it a bit. Cover lightly with flower. Put some olive or vegetable oil in a fry pan and cook the croquettes. They're done once nice and golden brown.

Cool to warm, then peel cloves and transfer to a food processor. Stem chiles and add to processor along with vinegar, sugar, and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt. Pulse until finely chopped. Simmer chile mixture in a small saucepan, stirring, 2 minutes. Wash jars, lids, and screw bands in hot, soapy water, then rinse well. Dry screw bands. Put empty jars on a rack in a boiling-water canner or a deep 6- to 8-quart pot and add enough hot water to cover by 2 inches. Bring to a boil, covered, then boil 10 minutes. Remove canner from heat, leaving jars in water, covered. Heat lids in water to cover by 2 inches in a small saucepan until water registers 180F on an instant-read or candy thermometer (do not let boil). Remove from heat. Keep jars and lids submerged in hot water, covered, until ready to use. Carefully remove jars and lids with canning tongs, then drain jars upside down on a clean kitchen towel and quickly dry lids. Place 2 or 3 thyme sprigs in each jar and ladle sauce (while still hot) into jars, leaving 1/4 inch of space at top. Run a clean rubber spatula between sauce and sides of jars to eliminate air bubbles. Wipe off rims of filled jars with a damp clean kitchen towel, then firmly screw on lids with screw bands. Put sealed jars in canner (on rack) or pot and add enough hot water to cover by 2 inches. (If you have a jar that is partially full, do not process it. Cover it with a lid and screw band, then keep in refrigerator.) Bring to a full boil, covered, then boil, covered, 10 minutes. Transfer jars with canning tongs to a towel-lined surface to cool. Jars will seal and eventually have concave lids (you may hear a ping). After jars have cooled, 12 to 24 hours, press center of each lid to check that it's concave, then remove screw band and try to lift lid with your fingertips. If you can't, the lid has a good seal.

You dont have to be too thorough with this. Place all the seeds into a bowl (you can roast them later and make pepitas). Repeat until all the pumpkin pieces are largely free of seeds and pulp. Place pumpkin pieces on a baking sheet (face up or face down; Ive done both) and roast in a 350-degree oven for 45 minutes, or until pumpkin is fork-tender. They should be nice and light golden brown when done. Peel off the skin from the pumpkin pieces until you have a big pile of the stuff. If you have a food processor, throw in a few chunks at a time. A blender will work, too, if you add a little water. Or you can simply mash it up with a potato masher, or move it through a potato ricer, or process it through a food mill. Pulse the pumpkin until smooth. If it looks too dry, add in a few tablespoons of water during the pulsing to give it the needed moisture. (Note, if the puree is overly watery, you should strain it on cheesecloth or over a fine mesh strainer to get rid of some of the liquid.) Dump the pureed goodness into a bowl, and continue pureeing until all the pumpkin is done. You can either use this immediately in whatever pumpkin recipe youd like, store it in the freezer for later use. To store in the freezer, spoon about 1 cupful of pumpkin into each plastic storage bag. Seal the bag with just a tiny bit of an opening remaining, then use your hands to flatten out the pumpkin inside the bag and push out the air. Store them in the freezer until you need them.",

(These are cooked separately to keep your nice broth from getting murky!) Strain broth into a large bowl. (This step is optional, but I prefer to remove the solids.) Once strained, pour broth back into pot. Add soy sauce, rice vinegar, vegetables, and tofu, and simmer until veggies are heated through, 1-2 minutes. Add soba noodles and heat for 1 more minute, until both noodles and broth are hot. Remove soup from heat and ladle into bowls. Serve alongside sliced green onions, chopped cilantro, and Sriracha. Note: This soup is best eaten immediately, as it wont reheat well once the vegetables and noodles have been added. If youre planning to have leftovers, I recommend saving half the broth just after straining and before adding anything else. For leftovers, you can assemble the bowl of soup just before reheating, to avoid having mushy veggies and noodles. Adapted from recipe for Homemade Pho from Jenna Weber of Eat, Live, Run.",

Using a handheld mixer or a stand mixer with the paddle attachment, beat the butter with the two sugars until creamy, about 2 minutes. Scrape down the bowl, and add the egg, milk, and vanilla extract, and beat together until combined. 3. Add the food coloring into the creamed mixture, and mix until combined. Scrape down the bowl once more, and add the flour mixture. Turn the mixer to low, and mix until the cookie dough is just combined. (Over-mixing can make the cookies tough and give them a strange texture.) A very soft dough will be formed. Mix in 1/2 cup of the white chocolate chips and mix just until combined. 4. Cover the dough and chill for 1 hour and up to 3 days. Chilling is mandatory. (You can also scoop the dough before chilling; see note.) 5. Preheat oven to 350 F. Line two baking sheets with silicone baking mats or parchment paper. 6. Scoop the cookies out onto the parchment paper using a large ice cream scoop (see note) spacing them at least a couple inches apart. Gently press the cookies down using the palm of your hand (you can wear a glove to keep everything clean). Using the remaining 1/4 cup white chocolate chips, gently press 4 or 5 into the tops of each cookie. 7. Bake the cookies for 12-14 minutes, until they have spread out and look puffy. Remove from oven. Let them cool on the baking sheet for 10 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. Enjoy! Notes: 1. I like to weigh my flour and sugar because it saves time and gives a very accurate reading. If you bake a lot and want to have your flour and sugar properly measured, I highly recommend buying one. 2. Let the egg come to room temperature by setting it out with your butter for at least an hour, or place the egg in a bowl of warm water for 10-15 minutes. 3. I like to scoop my dough before I chill it because Ive found that chilled dough can be really hard to scoop. This dough was a little sticky to scoop out, but wearing gloves really helps. 4. I like using large ice cream scoops when baking cookies because they bake up really big like bakery cookies. I just bought a cheap one at the grocery store for $4 or $5. 5.

Remove from the oven and allow to cool. 6. Store in a tightly sealed container at room temperature. Pretzels stay fresh for around 3 weeks, if they last that long. Enjoy! Notes: 1. Use cayenne depending on how spicy you like your pretzels. I added the listed amount of cayenne. Then I tasted the pretzels after they were coated in seasoning, and decided I wanted more heat. So I added about 1/4 teaspoon more. Make sure you taste after you season them, and adjust seasonings accordingly. 2.

        "instructions": "Trim chicken breasts of any fat. Take each breast and flatten it out with a mallet. If the breasts are very thick, you will want to filet them before pounding them out thin. I had four thick breasts, which I had to filet and then pound out thin. Set the chicken to the side and then prepare your work station for dipping and flouring. Crack the eggs into a shallow bowl and beat together well. You can add a teaspoon of cool water to the eggs to help thin them out a bit. In a separate shallow bowl, add your flour and season with your salt and pepper. Stir to combine. Dip each chicken breast first in the flour, then the egg, and then the flour again, pressing to make sure you get a nice even coat. Set each breast on a plate until you finish dipping and breading each one. Set the oven to 350 degrees. In a non-stick skillet, add 2 tablespoons of olive oil and set the heat to medium. Once hot, add two chicken breasts at a time and cook until just done on each side. You want them to be a very light golden brown. We are not looking for a deep brown color to these. Continue adding 2 tablespoons of olive oil for each 2 chicken breasts you brown. Cook each breast until just about done. Remove to a casserole dish and continue browning each chicken breast. Once you are done, place the casserole dish with the chicken in the oven uncovered and allow to cook for 10 12 minutes. Meanwhile, wipe out the skillet with some paper towels. You dont want to clean the pan completely, but you do want to remove all that flour that has browned in the bottom. You wont remove the flavor by doing this, but you will allow yourself to have a nice lemon colored sauce. Set the burner to medium heat and pour in your chicken broth. Add some salt and pepper if you feel it needs it. Squeeze in the juice of two lemons. Bring to a bowl and then quickly whisk in about 1 teaspoon of flour. Add in the butter and whisk again. Turn the heat down to simmer and allow to reduce to almost half. Once the sauce is done, add the chopped fresh parsley and stir. Set the chicken breasts out on a rimmed platter or baking dish, and pour the sauce all over the top of each breast. Take your last lemon and slice it thin, with the skin on. Place pieces of sliced lemon across the whole dish and serve.",

PREPARE THE MARINADE/GLAZE: Heat a griddle or large cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Tear chiles into flat pieces and toast a few at a time, pressing them against the hot surface, until they crack and blister; flip them and press down again. Transfer chiles to a large bowl and cover with boiling water; weight down with a plate to keep them submerged, and soak at least 30 minutes. Meanwhile, roast the garlic in the same griddle or skillet, turning frequently, until soft inside and blackened outside, about 15 minutes. Cool and peel. Drain chiles, reserving 3/4 cup soaking liquid; put chiles into a blender with garlic, cloves, sesame seeds, vinegar, cumin, peppercorns or ground pepper, and salt. Process/blend until mixture is smooth; then strain through a medium-mesh sieve into a bowl. Remove 1/2 cup of mixture to a small bowl, and stir in the sugar; set aside to use for the final glazing. MARINATE THE MEAT: Spread the rest of the chile paste thoroughly over the meat. Cover completely and refrigerate at least 18 hours. COOK (SLOW-STEAM) THE MEAT: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. Use a deep wide roasting pan that has a tight lid. Put a roasting rack into the bottom of the pan (it must sit at least 1 inch above the bottom of the pan---if not, prop it up with custard cups, tin cans, etc.) Measure in 4 cups of water. Then lay the marinated meat onto the rack and spread any marinade remaining in the marinating pan or dish. Cut a double thickness of heavy-duty foil to cover the roasting pan; place the pan lid over, making sure the pan is covered as tightly as possible. Bake 4 hours. FINISHING THE BROTH: Remove the pan lid and foil; carefully remove the tender meat to a platter. Take out the rack; spoon the fat off the broth with a ladle. Measure out the broth into a 1-quart container; add water to equal 1 quart liquid if necessary, and pour into a saucepan. Puree the tomato in a blender and add it to the broth along with the oregano and cinnamon. Cover; simmer over medium-low heat 45 minutes. Season with salt. GLAZE THE MEAT: Heat oven to 375 degrees. Remove meat from the bones, keeping pieces of meat as large as possible; discard bones, gristle and excess fat. Set meat on a baking sheet; brush lightly with reserved chile paste glaze, and bake 10 minutes to set the glaze. TO SERVE: Keep tortillas warm in a towel-covered basket. Serve the broth in a tureen. Present the meat on a large platter, or slice meat across the grain to serve it in deep plates, awash in the broth. Combine onion and coriander in a small bowl to pass with the lime at the table.",

        "instructions": "Whisk together the yeast, water and sugar, salt, oil, egg yolks, egg, vanilla and lemon extract. Blend well and stir in most of the flour to form a soft dough. Knead by hand, machine or in bread machine (dough setting), adding flour as needed. The dough should have some body, not too slack, supple, smooth and elastic. Place in a greased plastic bag and refrigerate at least 2 to 4 hours or overnight. If you are in a hurry, allow dough to rest at least 20 minutes, then proceed. If dough has risen at all, punch or flatten down, then pinch off pieces and form into small balls, about the size of golf balls. Otherwise, roll dough out to about three-quarters of an inch. Using a two and half inch or three inch biscuit cutter, cut out rounds. Cover and let sit 15 minutes while heating oil. In a deep fryer, or heavy dutch oven, heat about four inches of oil or a combination of oil and melted shortening. Add the doughnuts to the hot oil (temperature should be about 375 F.) and fry until the undersides are deep brown. Turn over once and finish frying the other side. Lift doughnuts out using a slotted spoon and drain well on paper towels. To fill, make a small opening and spoon in jam or jelly, or just sprinkle lightly with regular or extra fine granulated sugar by shaking doughnuts in a paper bag. Test oil temperature: It's a good idea to try frying one doughnut to start with. Once the doughnut seems done, take it out and cut it open to see if the inside is cooked.",

Knead the mixture for about 5 minutes, until it forms a smooth ball. Set the dough aside and cover with a damp cloth. Let it rest for about an hour. In a small bowl, mix all your sauce ingredients. After the dough has rested, cut the dough in half and leave one half under the damp cloth. Put the other section of dough onto a large, lightly floured work surface. Use a rolling pin and roll it into a big rectangle, as thin as you can get it. Rub about half a tablespoon of oil all over the surface of the dough and sprinkle with half of the chopped scallions, salt, and sesame seeds (if using). Cut 2 slits on each long side of the dough (cut about 1/3 of the way into the center of the dough but dont cut all the way across the rectangle). See related blog link for step-by-step photos. With the rolled out dough oriented vertically (the short side near you), start at the bottom and fold the two side flaps of dough over the middle piece. Then fold that entire rectangle forward onto the middle level. Then fold the next set of flaps over, and repeat. When you have your nice, neat rectangle of folded dough, take your rolling pin and roll it until almost doubled in area. Take care not to roll too firmly, as you dont want the dough layers to bind and you want to keep some small pockets of air between them. Heat a couple tablespoons of oil in a pan over medium heat and add the pancake. Cover the pan and cook for about five minutes on each side, or until golden brown. Transfer to a cutting board, slice, and serve with your dipping sauce. Repeat the process with the other half of the dough and scallion mixture.",

Add the rice and saute it, stirring constantly, until it gets (evenly) light brown. Pour in the strained tomato puree, stir it gently and let it cook (or dejalo freirlet it fryas my Mom says) until the puree has changed color to a darkened one, the consistency is thicker and it not longer looks so watery. Stir in 1 1/4 cup of vegetable broth (save the rest for the end, just in case), adjust the salt, gently stir and top with the jardinera garnish (optional). Cover the skillet with a lid (preferably a transparent one) and reduce the heat to very low. Let it simmer very gently. It will take about 20 -25 minutes. Rice should be fluffy and tender. Add the cilantro sprigs to the rice and cover. If its done, turn off the heat and let it rest for a couple of minutes before serving it. If the rice is not cooked through and most of the liquid has been absorbed, add just a few tablespoons of that vegetable broth you saved. Cover again, and cook for another 5 minutes or so. When the rice is cooked, remove the skillet from the heat and let it rest covered for another 5 minutes before you serve it. Hint: you can prepare this in advance (even a day or two in advance) and just reheat it in the oven, microwave or directly on the stove; just add a couple a tablespoons of broth or water.

Once the pot gets hot, add the meat and brown on all sides. Preheat your oven to 300 degrees. Remove the meat from the pot and set aside. Remove some of the oil from the pot, but not all of it. Leave about 2 tbsp. in there. Cut the white onion into large chunks and run 4 or 5 large cloves of garlic through a microplane or garlic press. Let the onions and garlic cook for a bit. Then add the chicken stock. Make sure you use stock, not broth. Next, add the wine. I like to use a dry wine like Chianti or Burgundy. Throw in 3 large bay leaves and then add the meat back into the pot. Use butchers twine and tie the sprigs of rosemary and thyme together and add to the pot too. Create an airtight seal between the lid and pot by lining the pot with parchment paper, then placing a sheet of aluminum foil under the lid. Ok folks, the trick to making melt-in-your-mouth, cut-with-a-spoon pot roast is to cook this baby slow and low. Put the pot in the oven for 3 1/2 hours on 300 degrees. Once done, remove the pot from the oven. Take the meat and set aside. Run the liquid through a sieve and only keep the liquid. Discard the bay leaf, herbs and onions. Dont worry, well add fresh ones in a minute. Put the liquid back in the pot and add the meat. Coarsely chop the red onions, and run 4 garlic cloves through your microplane. Add to the pot. Next, take a lemon, and wash it off. Using your microplane, take the zest of the lemon and add to the pot. Cut the lemon in half and add the juice to the pot. Adding the lemon juice and zest really brightens the flavor of this dish. Add the carrots. Chop up 1/4 cup of parsley and add to the pot. Also, add a few thyme leaves. In a small cup, mix 1/3 cup of water and arrowroot, then add this mixture to the sauce to thicken up a bit. Lastly, add the tomato paste into the pot and whisk into the sauce.

        "instructions": "To grill the corn: 1. Over medium heat, place the corn (in their husks!) on the grill, directly over the flames. Turn the corn every 2-3 minutes, when the husks begin to blacken. The silk or ends of the husks might catch fire as they dry out. I think this adds an amazing smoky flavor to the corn, but if youre scared (chicken! ), just make sure to trim those bits off before you put them on the grill. (Practice proper safety! Always use long tongs when handling the corn, and keep your digits away from the flame.) 2. When the husks are good and charred and the kernels are mostly cooked, remove the corn from the grill and place it in a pan or bowl you have standing by until it cools down a bit. Carefully peel back and remove the husks, watching out for any trapped hot steam. Place the naked ears (teehee!) back on the grill and turn every 1-2 minutes, or until as many kernels as possible have browned and caramelized. Brown equals sweet flavor! 3. Remove the corn from the grill, and when it is cool enough to handle, cut the kernels from the cob. Once youve removed the kernels, scrape the back of your knife along the cob to really get all the creamy corn bits out of there. To make the pesto: Blend the corn and all the remaining ingredients in a food processor, minus the olive oil. When the ingredients are well blended, with the food processor running, stream in the olive oil until a thinned out sauce forms. Add enough olive oil until your desired consistency is reached. Serve over pasta, meat, or shredded vegetables. * Note: You can toast almonds in the oven at 350 degrees F for a few minutes or in a dry pan over low heat. Just cook them until you can smell their oils releasing. I use my toaster oven. Its fastest.",

In a large bowl (or better yet, use the bowl of your electric mixer), cream together your butter and sugars. Once your mixture has lightened in color and is way fluffy, add your eggs one at a time. Scrape bowl down after each egg addition. 4. Add in your vanilla extract. Mix together well. Slowly add your dry ingredients into your butter/sugar/egg mixture and mix together until just combined. Lastly, add white chocolate chips and mix in. 5. Using a 2 ice cream scoop, scoop out nice even amounts of dough and space then on your tray about 1.5 apart. This is going to make HUGE cookies. (Use a smaller scoop and decrease the baking time, if you want smaller cookies) Just remember, these cookies will bake and spread out quite a bit. Bake about 16 minutes for a chewier cookie, 18 minutes for a crispier one. Again, if using the said 2 scoop. ** Always check your cookies a few minutes before said baking time because everyones oven temperature is a little different. Theyre done when theyve flattened out a little and have a nice crispy top with cracks. 6. Let cool and enjoy!

Spread the rolls open and arrange on a baking sheet. Sprinkle each roll with a 1/4 cup of the cheese and put them under the broiler until the cheese is melted and bubbling, about 1 to 2 minutes. In a small bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise and hot sauce. Spread the mayonnaise onto the bottom of each roll. Put a quarter of the beef into each of the rolls. (Reserve 4 pieces of beef for the Round 2 Recipe Couscous Stuffed Tomatoes). Cover with the roll tops, cut in half and serve.",

Once the dough has risen, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and divide it into 8 equal portions (if youd like to make rolls) or 2 equal portions (if youd like to make a loaf) (using a sharp knife or a dough scraper works well). Shape each into a ball or loaf and place on a parchment-lined baking sheet (try not to handle the dough too much at this point).

Let stand for 20 minutes after applying the topping. The Topping. Combine all ingredients in a large bowl and beat with a whisk; beat hard to combine. The consistency should be like stiff royal icing spreadable, but not too runny. If you pull some up with your whisk it should look like soft peaks. Add more water or rice flour as necessary. Let stand 15 minutes. Coat the top of each loaf or roll with a thick layer of topping. You should err on the side of applying too much topping a thin layer will not crack properly. Sprinkle on the optional salt if you wish-I did. Let stand, uncovered, for 15 minutes. Bake in a preheated 375 degrees oven for 25-30 minutes, until well browned.

Size) Reames Frozen Egg Noodles,1 can (14 Oz. Can) French Style Green Beans,6 ounces, weight Neufchatel Cream Cheese",
        "instructions": "Start with a 6-quart pot. Add between 1 and 2 quarts of water to boil your chicken. In the meantime, start chopping the vegetablesdice up your onion, carrots and celery. By the time youre finished with this, your chicken should be close to done. My chicken breasts usually only take about 20 minutes at a rolling boil; check it to make sure. Remove your chicken from the water (stock) youve just boiled it in, and set it aside to cool for a few minutes. Turn heat down to just a simmer, add the veggies you just chopped and let simmer for 2030 minutes. While the veggies are at work, start shredding your chicken. This takes forever no matter how many times Ive done it before. Once your chicken is all shredded, add the chicken broth, salt, pepper and chicken to the pot. Turn the heat up and bring back to a low boil. Once everything is back to a low boil, youll finally add the good stuff! Toss in Reames egg noodles and green beans. Stir frequently for about 35 minutes; the egg noodles can get weird and stick together, but its only happened to me once. Now for the last, and best part of all: the cream cheese. Youll want to put it in the soup in clumps, about 12 tablespoons or so. Thats just an estimate though, dont get technical, just eyeball it. As you drop your clumps in, push them below the surface so theyre entirely submerged. We want it to melt nicely. No need to stir much, youll just make it separate and look really strange (again I did this the first couple times I made this and it turned out weird-looking, but tasted great). It takes about 5 minutes to melt entirely. The end. I usually leave this to simmer, as low of a setting as I can, for 13 hours. Just depends how far in advance Ive made it. This soup is thick and hearty, great with sourdough. It becomes very thick like a casserole in a couple of hours, and then can be eaten with a fork! Hope you enjoy!",

        "instructions": "For the rolls: In a small saucepan, combine the milk, water, and unsalted butter. Heat over low heat, until the butter has melted and the mixture has reached 110 degrees F. Sprinkle the yeast on top and allow to activate for 10 minutes. Once the yeast has activated (it will start to foam), sprinkle in the sugar. Add the yeast mixture to the bowl of a stand mixer, with dough hook attached. Add in flour and salt, and knead on low until a soft dough forms. Add the egg and continue to knead until the dough starts to pull away from the sides and form a ball around the dough hook. If you find that the dough is too runny, add the remaining 1/2 cup of flour. Knead on medium speed for 4 minutes and then transfer the dough to an oiled bowl to rest for 15 minutes. (Note: If you dont have a stand mixer with dough hook, you may use a food processor with dough blade. You may also go old school and knead with your hands.) Generously flour a work surface and roll the dough into a 15x10 inch rectangle. For the filling, take the unsalted butter and spread it onto the dough. If you need/want more, then feel free to add more. Combine the cinnamon and sugar in a small bowl then sprinkle on top of the butter. Roll the dough into a log, starting at the longest edge (the 15-inch edge). Roll tightly, making sure to not crack the dough. With the seam side down, slice the dough into 12 equal-sized pieces. Grease a 9-inch pie dish, and lay the rolls, cut side down, into the pie dish. Cover loosely, and place the rolls in a warm place (I like to use my oven, turned off). Let rise for 1 1/2 hours to 2 hours, or until the rolls have doubled in size. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F and bake rolls for 25-30 minutes, covering them halfway through if they start to brown too much. Remove from heat and allow to cool slightly while you prepare you glaze. For the glaze: In a medium bowl, whisk together the confectioners sugar, vanilla extract and whole milk until smooth and no clumps remain. Drizzle the glaze on top of the rolls and sprinkle with sprinkles if desired. Serve warm or store in an airtight container where they will keep for 3-4 days. Enjoy!",

        "instructions": "Brining poultry is an easy and relatively foolproof way to ensure you end up with a juicy, succulent bird. The brine is simple: mix 1/2 cup kosher salt and 2 tbsp. sugar in a gallon of water. I recommend lining a large pot or bucket with a plastic bag first, then adding the chicken, tying the bag to prevent any leaks. You can brine for as little as an hour to as long as overnight. In this case, I brined the chicken for about five hours. After removing the chicken from the brine, give it a thorough rinse and pat dry with paper towels. Rub the inside of the bird with salt and pepper. Next, slice a lemon in half and pierce the lemon with two whole cloves. Add the lemon to the cavity. Peel four cloves of garlic and add to the cavity as well. If you have fresh herbs on hand, they would make a great addition. Next, carefully slide your hand in between the skin of the chicken and the breast to create a pocket. Add a tablespoon of butter to each breast and massage the butter into the chicken. Use any remaining butter to rub over the top of the chicken. Generously season with salt and pepper. Finally, tie the legs of the chicken together using kitchen string or twine. Set aside. Meanwhile, thinly slice one large yellow onion and line the bottom of a roasting pan or glass baking dish with the slices. Gently position the chicken on top of the onion slices. Roast at 450 degrees for 50 minutes (3-4 lb. chicken) to 1 1/2 hours (5-6 lb. chicken) or until the juices run clear and the breast temperature measures 180 degrees. Let sit for 10-15 minutes before serving.",

        "instructions": "1. Prepare the aioli. In a food processor, combine 13 of the minced garlic, 1 teaspoon of the chili paste and the egg yolks. Start the food processor and after a few seconds, very slowly drizzle in all of the olive oil until blended. Add the roasted red pepper and pulse until smooth. Transfer to a non-metal bowl, cover and set aside. 2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the remaining minced garlic, 1 tablespoon of the Asian chili paste, the lemon juice and rice vinegar. Add the prawns and stir to coat with the mixture. Transfer the contents of the bowl into a zippered storage bag and refrigerate for 30 minutes. 3. Heat a large saute pan over medium heat. Remove the prawns from the marinade and set aside. Add the marinade to the pan and heat until it begins to simmer. Add the prawns and poach for 2 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and then turn the prawns over to finish cooking another 1 minute off the heat. Serve the prawns alone or on a bed of sesame fire noodles with a dollop of the aioli on top and more on the side for dipping. Tips and trending: If you have concerns about using raw egg yolks in the aioli, combine 13 of the garlic, the chili paste and the roasted red pepper with 1 1/2 cups of mayonnaise. Keep covered at room temperature while you prepare the prawns. Poaching shrimp instead of boiling produces much more tender results. Try poaching shrimp this way the next time you prepare some for a salad or shrimp cocktail. Smaller shrimp are easy to overcook, so set a stainless steel bowl in an ice bath, remove the cooked shrimp from the poaching liquid and toss them around in the ice cold bowl to halt the cooking. Then put the shrimp in a zipper storage bag and refrigerate until ready to use.",

Pour in cup of water and add bouillon cube. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. Once bouillon cube has dissolved add cream and stir, removing from heat. *Give the soup a quick taste to see if salt is needed. Generally the bouillon cube is salty enough so you will probably not need it. Transfer small amounts of the soup into a blender, trying to keep an even liquid to vegetable ratio. Puree until there are little to no chunks left and pour into another saucepan. Continue this until all the mixture is pureed, leaving you with a hearty, thick soup. **If you want to freeze batches, do not add the cream. Puree the soup as normal, omitting the cream and add cream at a later time when the soup is defrosted. ***I use heavy whipping cream because I love the rich taste. If you want to cut back perhaps use only 3/4 cup or use a lower cream altogether. I find the heavy cream gives the soup a nice texture. ****Instead of using water and a bouillon cube you could always use store bought broth.",

Add some mayonnaise to taste, and sprinkle with black pepper. If you serve tomatoes or boiled eggs on the side the plate will be more colorful and filling too. If you mix the cut up chicken just before serving with finely shredded vegetables, add French dressing and black pepper, it will become a salad you can serve to guests.",

        "ingredients": "2 Tablespoons Yeast,3 cups Warm Water, divided,1 Tablespoon Sugar,1 cup Shortening,1/2 cups Sugar,2 teaspoons Salt,4 whole Eggs,7- 1/2 cups Flour,1/2 cups Butter",
        "instructions": "Combine the yeast, 1 cup warm water and 1 Tablespoon of sugar in the bottom of the bowl of your mixer. Mine is a Bosch, with dough hooks. Let this sit until the yeast is bubbly. While that is happening prepare the shortening. Scoop the shortening into your glass measuring cup, and soften it in the microwave for about a minute. Dont make it too hot and liquid-ey or you will kill the yeast that you are preparing. Next, add the shortening, the remaining sugar, salt, and another cup of warm water to the yeast mixture. Use your mixer to combine all the ingredients. Just get them mixed up, they really dont have to be smooth. Finally, add the eggs and the remaining cup of warm water. Add one cup of flour at a time after you start your mixer. The dough needs to be pretty sticky, so dont use too much flour. When youre done scraping all the flour into the bowl without sending up a flour dust cloud, set the timer for 10 minutes and set your mixer on knead. This is very important you need to make sure you knead that dough for a full 10 minutes. Strangely enough, I have done this so many times that I can hear the gluten in my dough activate because the sound of the machine changes, and not more than another minute goes by and then the timer goes off. Spray a large bowl with non-stick spray and get the dough out of your mixing bowl. Because your dough is sticky, use a spatula and scrape it out into your large mixing bowl. Sprinkle the top of the dough with a bit of flour, and cover with a towel. Place the bowl of dough in the refrigerator and allow to chill overnight if you can. I like mine to chill but I never have more than 4 hours to give it. The dough handles and performs better when chilled. If you dont have the time, it still all works out. Go straight to preparing the dough. Now, to make your croissants, have a pizza cutter ready, and 1/2 cup of butter completely melted in a bowl. Divide the dough in the bowl into four equal sections. Take 1/4 of the dough out onto a floured surface and with a rolling pin, smooth the dough out into a circle about the size of a pie crust. Pour a fourth of the melted butter on top of the first dough section and spread it to the edges, covering equally. With the pizza cutter, cut the circle of dough into eight pie-shaped pieces. Roll each piece from the wide end to the center point (thus creating your crescent rolls). Move rolls to a baking sheet, and curl the points in just a bit towards each other. Repeat with each triangular piece of dough. Repeat the whole process over with the other three sections of dough and the rest of the butter until you have 32 rolls on your sprayed baking sheets. I need three baking sheets for this recipe. Cover your rolls and baking sheets with a towel and allow them to raise to a nice fluffy size. Bake in a preheated oven at 350 degrees F for 8 minutes or just until golden brown. Sometimes that first batch needs a bit more time than 8 minutes, the rest dont usually.",

So I decided because I am always running late I would try something else instead of boiling a few breasts myself. I use precooked fajita chicken strips. I know ... Im such a rebel. So anyway, lets get this show on the road. Start by setting your oven to 350 F. Take the chicken strips, warm them in a skillet as directed on the package. Once these are warm, you can either chop them finely or you can throw them in a food processor. Now that you have your chicken chopped up, put it into a large bowl and mix it together with all of the ingredients, reserving 1/2 cup of the cheese for the topping. Pour the dip into an oven safe dish and bake for 20-25 minutes at 350 F. Once you pull it out of the oven, top with the remaining cheese and serve with tortilla chips and cold beer.",

Combine the pumpkin puree, melted butter, eggs and salt in a separate bowl. Stir until fully incorporated. After the yeast has had 10 minutes to bloom, add the pumpkin mixture to it and stir until combined. Add 5 cups of flour and turn on the mixer fitted with the dough hook. Mix until combined. Press your finger into the dough to test it. If it is still sticky, add the remaining 1/2 cup of flour. The dough should be soft but not sticky. Place the dough in a large bowl that you have sprayed with cooking spray. Cover it with a sheet of plastic that youve sprayed with cooking spray and put it in the fridge overnight. Check on it before you go to bed, I had to punch mine down as it was overflowing the bowl. The next morning, remove the dough from the refrigerator and place it on the counter (still in the bowl). Take the stick of butter (for the frosting) and place in a medium skillet on medium high heat. Melt the butter, stirring it constantly until little brown flecks appear on the bottom. Once that happens immediately remove pan from the heat and set aside to cool. Next, work on the filling. Combine the brown sugar, butter and cinnamon in a large bowl until it creates a paste. Set aside for now. Heavily dust your rolling surface with flour. Plop the dough in the middle and roll it out to about 30x16. Sprinkle the filling onto the dough and smoosh it down with your fingers. Starting with one of the long ends, roll the dough up as tightly as you can into a log. Using a sharp knife score and slice the log into rolls. Mine were about 2 inches thick. Place the rolls in a greased 9x12 baking dish. Let the rolls rise in a warm place for an hour and a half to two hours. Preheat the oven to 350 F. Once oven is heated, place the rolls in the oven for 15-20 minutes. Mine baked for 20 minutes. Test by pressing down in the middle of a roll. It shouldnt sink. While the rolls are baking, work on the frosting. In a medium bowl, combine the cream cheese, cooled brown butter, powdered sugar and half-and-half. Mix with a hand mixer until fully combined. Remove the rolls from the oven and liberally spread the frosting over them. En-freaking-joy. Recipe adapted from: Mels Kitchen Cafe",

        "instructions": "Lay diced zucchini on a couple layers of paper towels, sprinkle with some salt, and cover with more paper towels. In a large, non-stick skillet, heat a tablespoon of vegetable oil over medium high. Add half of the butternut squash in a single layer and sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon salt. After 5 minutes of undisturbed cook time, stir occasionally for another 5 minutes, until browned and tender. Set aside in a large, heatproof bowl. Repeat with more oil and remaining squash. Set the bowl of squash aside once done. Press down firmly on the towel-covered zucchini to finish absorbing excess liquid before cooking. Return skillet to medium high heat. Once hot, add 2 teaspoons oil and heat until shimmering. Add bell pepper and half the minced jalapeno, and cook until starting to brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Add zucchini and cook in close to a single layer, stirring infrequently, until zucchini starts to brown. Remove the mixture to the bowl with the squash, also adding the beans and half of the sliced scallions. Stir to combine. Preheat oven to 375 F. Scald milk in a small saucepan, heating over medium until bubbles form around the edges, then turn off heat and cover to keep warm. In a medium saucepan, melt 2 1/2 tablespoons butter over medium heat. Add minced scallions and the remaining minced jalapeno and cook a few minutes, until softened. If its foaming vigorously, reduce heat slightly before continuing. Add flour and chili powder and stir with a wooden utensil for 3 minutes, until cooked and paste-like. With heat on low, slowly drizzle and whisk the warm milk into the flour mixture (roux). Increase heat to medium-high once all the milk has been added and switch back to a wooden spoon, stirring constantly to keep flour from settling in corners and bottom of pan. Once simmering, reduce heat to the lowest possible simmer. Still stirring constantly, cook for 10 minutes, until sauce has thickened. Turn off the heat and whisk in cream cheese until incorporated. Then stir in 3 cups of the shredded cheese, half at a time, until melted. Season to taste with salt, starting with 1 teaspoon. Pour sauce over the vegetable mixture and stir to coat. Scoop into 6 buttered ramekins (or a medium-sized, roughly 2-quart casserole dish) and sprinkle with the last cup of cheese. Bake for 20 minutes, until bubbling. Cool slightly and garnish with remaining scallion slices. Notes: 1. Because the roux includes chili powder, its color will not indicate when its cooked. Make sure to cook at least 3 minutes to avoid a raw flour taste. 2. Ive made the sauce without cream cheese, and its still tasty. However, it lacks the really creamy texture you get when using it. 3. For a main dish, its fun to bake in individual dishes or ramekins. For a side, bake in a medium (around 2 quart) casserole dish, so diners can choose their serving size. 4. Freeze individual ramekins before baking and topping with cheese, if you know you wont eat them right away. Cooking once always yields better results than cooking twice when it comes to freezing casseroles, as Im learning.",

Microwave for 1 minute at 600 W if they're just out of the fridge. Let the residual heat dissolve the butter. Preheat the oven to 180C with the cookie cutters inside (this prevents the batter from leaking when you're pouring them into the cookie cutter). Separate the egg yolks and egg whites. Add all the sugar into the egg whites. Whip the egg whites to make a meringue. Whip until stiff peaks form. Whip the egg yolks until white and creamy. Mix the melted butter and milk into the egg yolk and whip until it gets frothy. Sift in the powder ingredients. Using a whisk, mix lightly in cutting motion. Add the meringue in 3 batches. Fold in lightly with a rubber spatula. Keep on mixing to make the mixture fine and smooth, and break in large bubbles. When the batter becomes smooth, pour it into the hot mold. Bake for 20 minutes at 180C. When done, take it out from the oven and drop from about a height of 20 cm to remove any trapped air. Remove from the mold and serve while it's hot.

        "instructions": "Preheat oven to 400F. Grease a 8x8 in. casserole dish with softened butter our spray with nonstick cooking spray, set aside. In a large sauce pan cook macaroni according to package directions, drain in colander and set aside. In the same sauce pan, melt butter with olive oil over med heat. The olive oil helps prevent browning of the butter. Stir in chopped onion and cook until translucent, stirring occasionally. About 2 minutes. Add flour stirring with whisk constantly for about 2 minutes more (to cook flour). Gradually pour in half and half, whisking constantly. Stir in salt, pepper and cayenne. Bring to a low boil and continue boiling for 2 minutes. Still whisking constantly. You must use half and half to truly accomplish a rich, creamy sauce. You could use milk if you want, but milk alone just doesn't cut it. Reduce heat and gently simmer (stirring constantly, you guessed it) for 10 minutes to thicken. Add shredded cheese a handful at a time. Whisking to incorporate each addition. Simmer, stirring, an additional 5 minutes, or until all cheese is melted. Turn off heat. Return macaroni to sauce pan and gently fold into cheese sauce. Adjust seasoning to taste. I usually need to add a little more salt once the pasta is added (up to another 1/2 tsp), and sometimes add extra cayenne if we want a little extra kick. Transfer to casserole dish. Now is where you add the topping if you want a little crunch. In a small bowl toss panko breadcrumbs with olive oil to coat. Sprinkle over top of mac n cheese. Bake, uncovered, 20 minutes or until top is golden brown and edges are bubbly. Notes: It is important to use extra sharp cheddar (or a mixture of sharp, strong cheeses) in order to really taste the cheese. Milder cheeses are not strong enough to truly provide a rich, cheesy flavor. I like using Kraft Shredded Triple Cheddar with a touch of Philly. If I feel like shedding my own I will get a block of good quality Vermont extra sharp white cheddar. If you want it extra, super cheese add up to an extra cup of cheese to your sauce. It's ok. I won't tell. ;-) Substitutions and mix-ins: you can sub 1/4 cup sliced leeks for the onion, or omit this ingredient completely (although I say keep it). Can also sub nutmeg for cayenne, these brighten all the flavors and bring it all together (i would not use both). For variations in flavor, mix in about 4 slices crispy, crumbled bacon or 1/2 cup frozen spinach, thawed and drained with all excess liquid squeezed out when you sure in pasta.",

        "instructions": "In a medium bowl, combine all of the ingredients except the ground pork or turkey. Whisk until the spices are moistened. Add the ground pork or turkey and stir until thoroughly combined (I use my hands). If you have time, cover the sausage and refrigerate for a couple of hours to allow the flavors to meld. If you dont, the sausage will still taste great. To cook, form the sausage into patties (or crumble if making sausage gravy). Cook over medium heat until the sausage has nicely browned on both sides. Notes: 1. I love this with ground turkey! I prefer ground turkey with a mixture of white and dark meat so the cooked sausage isnt so dry. 2. Buying ground pork from the grocery store is a big time-saver. However, it can sometimes be hit or miss. Commercially ground pork averages about 70% lean meat. Ground pork can come from various parts of the pig so you really never know what youre getting. If you have a grinder or food processor (or a nice butcher! ), grind your own pork so you know what cuts are going into the sausage. 3. For an ULTRA low-fat version: Buy some pork tenderloin on sale and trim off all of the fat. I cut it into 1 cubes (1 pound of pork after trimming) and freeze it in single layer on a sheet pan for about 20 minutes or so. The outside should be firm but the inside should be pliable. While the pork is freezing, combine the other ingredients in a small bowl and whisk to combine. Sometimes, I substitute vegetable oil for the water (shhhhh!) when using this method so it is not as dry. Transfer the pork to a food processor and dump the herb mixture on top. Whiz the pork (scraping down the bowl as necessary) until it is as finely/coarsely ground as you like. Pork tenderloin is similar to a boneless, skinless chicken breast in fat content so this preparation is great for someone who wants pork sausage on a low-fat diet. As with many other ground, low-fat proteins, this ultra low-fat version can get a little dry and spongy when cooked. The flavor is great if you dont mind a drier sausage with a slightly spongy texture. Its not my favorite way to make it but I offer this as a very healthful alternative. 4. I, personally, like the clean taste of white sugar in sausage. Feel free to substitute brown sugar or maple syrup if thats your thing.",

Let the sauce simmer for a while (10-30 mins) to let all the ingredients become mushy, OR, if you are not patient, put the sauce in a blender/liquidiser. BONUS TIP: When you simmer the sauce, try adding the tomato branches. Following, when you are done simmering, let the sauce cool for 5-10 minutes. Then remove the branches and proceed accordingly. I haven't tried it yet, but, according to a ratatouille recipe, it should be really nice. Pour on pizza dough, and add all topping you can image to be delicious. This is a sauce recipe.

        "instructions": "Preheat oven to 400. Fill a pot with 3 qts of water and bring to a boil; add rice and stir well. Cook covered for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until rice is cooked but still firm to the bite. Drain and transfer to a mixing bowl. Toss the rice with a bit of butter to prevent grains from sticking together. While the rice is cooking, make a bechamel sauce. Heat the milk till you can see steam rising (do not boil). Melt the 4 T butter in a heavy saucepan over medium low heat. Add the flour and whisk till smooth. Add the hot milk a few tablespoons at a time at first, whisking till mixture is smooth before adding more milk. It will likely be very thick at first, but will become thinner as you whisk in more milk. As it thins, you can mix in more milk at a time. Cook, whisking constantly over medium low heat till sauce thickly coats the whisk. Season with salt and pepper and remove from heat. Pour the bechamel sauce over the rice, reserving a few spoonfuls for the top of the casserole. Add the ham and all but 2 T of the parmigiano-reggiano. Mix well and season to taste with salt and pepper. Butter the bottom and sides of a 2 1/2 qt baking dish that is about 3 1/2 inches deep. Pour in half the rice mixture. Slice the mozzarella about 1/8 inch thick and layer the slices over the rice. Add the remaining rice mixture and smooth the surface with a spoon. Spread the remaining bechamel over the top and sprinkle with the remaining 2 T parmegiano-reggiano. Bake for 15 minutes. If after 15 minutes, the top is not speckled with brown, place the casserole under the broiler for 1-2 minutes, or till top begins to brown. Remove from the oven and allow to settle for about 5 minutes before serving.",

Cook this on medium-high heat until it simmers, then cover, reduce the heat and cook for about 30 minutes. Check around this time, stirring with a spoon. The water should have evaporated. Remove from the heat, remove the lid, and fluff with a spoon or fork. While the quinoa is cooking, add the butter and oil to a skillet. Bring to a medium-high heat, then toss in the mushrooms. Stir. Season with a bit of salt and pepper. Cook for about 15 minutes or until the mushrooms begin to caramelize. Steam the broccoli, then chop. Once the quinoa is finished, add it to a mixing bowl. Toss in the caramelized mushrooms, and the broccoli. Stir, and taste. Season with any additional salt or pepper. The great thing about this recipe is that it is low fat, packed with nice protein, and has awesome side dish written all over it. So if you are looking for something new to try and get away from pasta or rice, give quinoa a shot. Im certain you will love it.",

Can),1/2 cups Butter, Divided,2 teaspoons Vanilla Extract",
        "instructions": "For the cake: Grease and flour a bundt pan. Preheat oven to 350 F. In a large bowl stir together the butter and sugar until fluffy. Mix in the egg and then the applesauce. Set aside. In a mixing bowl combine the flour, baking soda, salt and spices. Sift this into the butter mixture and mix until just combined. Add the water and mix to combine. Fold in nuts if using. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and spread to even the top. Bake on the middle rack of the oven for about 40-50 minutes or until the cake bounces back or a toothpick, when inserted, comes out clean. Remove pan from oven. Let cake cool in the pan for 3 minutes, set on an elevated cooling rack. Using a knife, carefully separate the cake from the edges and middle of the pan. Jiggle and bounce the cake pan a little to loosen the cake. Place a plate on top of the pan and flip the cake over. Allow the cake to cool. For the icing: In a small bowl mix together the milk and sugar and pour over the cake while it is still very warm. For the caramel sauce: Combine the sugar and water in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally until it comes to a boil. Then let it boil without stirring for 10-14 minutes or until the color is a deep caramel color. Remove from heat immediately. Pour in the sweetened condensed milk and stir (do not scrape the sides). Stir in 1/4 cup butter, 1 tablespoon at a time. Add in the rest of the butter and the vanilla and stir until smooth. Serve warm over the cake. Caramel sauce recipe adapted from Very Best Baking.",

        "instructions": "In heavy duty mixer bowl (fitted with dough hook attachment), stir together yeast & 2 cups of flour. In small saucepan over med-high heat, combine salt, sugar, milk & shortening. Stir with wooden spoon until shortening is nearly melted & just has a couple tiny, pea-sized lumps floating around (approx 120 degrees on candy thermometer). Pour hot mixture into mixer bowl with yeast & flour, add both eggs & begin mixing on low to medium speed til mixture is all wet. Begin slowly adding spoonfuls of flour & mixing until dough forms into ball around the dough hook & bottom of mixer bowl is no longer sticky with wet dough. Ball of dough will be slightly smooth & spring back when touched with fingertip. Remove dough from hook & bowl & form into ball with hands. Spray inside of bowl with non-stick cooking spray & then drop dough ball into bowl with the smooth side down. Then turn ball over so the seam side is now down. (This greases top & bottom of ball). Cover mixer bowl with it's lid,a towel or foil & place in warm area to rise for about an hour. Dough will be about double the starting size in an hour. When risen, use fist to \"punch\" dough down in center. Then remove from bowl & divide into two balls. Place both on lightly floured surface & cover loosely with foil. Let rest 10 minutes. Roll out one ball at a time into large circle about 1/2 inch or less in thickness. Use pizza cutter to slice dough like a pizza into about 12 or so triangles. Roll each triangle up starting at large end & ending with the \"tail\" end. Place 2 inches apart on ungreased baking sheet with tail on bottom. Cover & let rise for another 15-20 minutes. Bake at 350 degrees for about 12 minutes (depending on oven being used & personal preference. I only bake ours 9-10 minutes because we like them light in color & a litte squishy in the middle). One ball makes about a dozen or more rolls & therefore I will quite often make one batch for dinner & freeze one of the balls. To freeze for later, instead of rolling out the dough ball wrap it in foil & then place in sealed ziplock freezer baggie. Freeze immediately. To use, thaw in fridge for approximately 8 hours or 3-5 hours on counter. When pliable, roll out & cut into wedges to roll & bake.",

While potatoes are cooking, whisk oil and vinegar together in a large bowl. Season to taste with salt; set aside. When potatoes are cool enough to handle without burning your fingers, cut them in 1\" cubes. Toss them in the oil and vinegar so they are coated well, and set them aside to cool to room temperature, tossing occasionally. In a small bowl, whisk together the sour cream, yogurt and horseradish. Mince the dill and add it to the sour cream mixture, stirring well. When potatoes have cooled to room temperature, add celery and toss to combine. Then add the sour cream mixture; toss again. Halve, pit and peel the avocados. Cut them into 1 inch cubes; place in a small bowl with the lime juice. Toss so the cubes are moistened with the juice.

        "instructions": "Stir together the cornmeal and white flour in a medium storage container. Sprinkle the yeast into the water, stir to mix, and pour over the cornmeal mixture. Mix with your fingers, pressing the mixture into the sides, bottom, and corners until all of the flour is wet and fully incorporated. Cover the container and let sit at room temperature for 10 to 14 hours. The starter will be at its peak at around 12 hours. Stir together the white flour, cornmeal, sugar, salt, and yeast in a medium bowl. Pour about one-third of the water around the edges of the starter to release it from the sides of the container. Transfer the starter and water to an extra-large bowl along with the remaining water and the bourbon. Using a wooden spoon, break the starter up to distribute it in the liquid. Add the flour mixture, reserving about one-sixth of it along the edge of the bowl. Continue to mix with the spoon until most of the dry ingredients have been combined with the starter mixture. Switch to a plastic bowl scraper and continue to mix until incorporated. At this point, the dough will be just slightly sticky to the touch. Push the dough to one side of the bowl. Roll and tuck the dough, adding the reserved flour mixture and a small amount of additional flour to the bowl and your hands as needed. Continue rolling and tucking until the dough feels stronger and begins to resist any further rolling, about 8 times. Then, with cupped hands, tuck the sides under toward the center. Place the dough, seam-side down, in a clean bowl, cover the top of the bowl with a clean kitchen towel, and let rest at room temperature for 30 minutes. For the first stretch and fold, lightly dust the work surface and your hands with flour. Using the plastic bowl scraper, release the dough from the bowl and set it, seam-side down, on the work surface. Gently stretch it into a roughly rectangular shape. Fold the dough in thirds from top to bottom and then from left to right. With cupped hands, tuck the sides under toward the center. Place the dough in the bowl, seam-side down, cover the bowl with the towel, and let rest for 30 minutes. For the second stretch and fold, repeat the steps for the first stretch and fold, then return the dough to the bowl, cover with the towel, and let rest for 30 minutes. For the third stretch and fold, gently stretch the dough into a rectangle. Pinch the butter into pieces, distributing them over the top of the dough. Using your fingers or a spatula, spread the butter across the surface of the dough. Roll up the dough tightly from the end closest to you; at the end of the roll the dough will be seam-side down. Turn it over, seam-side up, and gently press on the seam to flatten the dough slightly. Fold in thirds from left to right and then do 4 or 5 roll and tuck sequences to incorporate the butter. Turn the dough seam-side down and tuck the sides under toward the center. Return the dough to the bowl, cover with the towel, and let rest for 30 minutes. For the fourth and final stretch and fold, repeat the steps for the first stretch and fold, then return the dough to the bowl, cover with the towel, and let rest for 20 minutes. Line a half sheet pan with a linen liner and dust fairly generously with the dusting mixture. Lightly dust the work surface and your hands with flour. Using a bench scraper, divide the dough into 2 equal pieces. Press each into a 7-inch (18 cm) square, then roll into a loose tube about 7 inches (18 cm) long Let rest for 5 minutes. Press each piece out and then shape into a very tight tube 9-10 inches (23 to 25 cm) long. Using a bench scraper, make 3 to 5 cuts on the diagonal down the loaf. Then, make 3 to 5 cuts in the opposite direction, crossing the first set of cuts, to make diamonds. Transfer to the lined pan, cut-side down, positioning the loaves lengthwise. Dust the top and sides of the dough with flour. Fold the linen to create support walls on both sides of each loaf, then fold any extra length of the linen liner over the top or cover with a kitchen towel. Transfer the pan to the refrigerator and chill for 16-22 hours. Set up the oven with a baking stone and a cast-iron skillet for steam, then preheat the oven to 480 degrees F (250 degrees C). Using the linen liner, lift and gently flip the loaves off the pan and onto a transfer peel cut-side up. Slide the loaves, still cut-side up, onto a dusted baking peel. Working quickly but carefully, transfer the loaves to the stone using heavy-duty oven mitts or potholders. Pull out the hot skillet, add about 3 cups of ice cubes, then slide it back in and close the oven door. Immediately lower the oven temperature to 440 degrees F (225 degrees C). Bake, switching the positions of the loaves about two-thirds of the way through baking, until the surface is a deep, rich brown, with some spots a long the scores being very dark (bien cuit), about 28 minutes. Using the baking peel, transfer the loaves to a cooling rack. When the bottoms of the loaves are tapped, they should sound hollow. If not, return to the stone and bake for 5 minutes longer. Let the bread cool completely before slicing and eating, at least 4 hours, but preferably 8 to 24 hours.",

Add cold water or equivalent amount of ice, fruit juice, and then liquor. Definitely use ice instead of the cold water if you are having the party in less than 4 hours because it will solidify faster. Taste to ensure there is enough liquor and consider adding more. If you use a citrus juice then you can add more liquor. Do NOT use pineapple juice, it will interfere with the gelatin setting. Pour the mixture into 3 oz Dixie cups, filling 2/3 full (after all, you want enough of these to go around). I normally lay down a sheet of wax paper, and then pour the cups and place them on a cookie sheet. If you do two batches you can place the cookie sheets on top of each other in the fridge. Drop small fruit slices or an individual berry into each shot cup for a classy touch. Then chill for at least 3 hours. To bring them to your friend's party, find a cardboard box.

Liberally salt and pepper both sides of the brisket and smoke for 2 hours (were not trying to cook it here, just get some smoke flavor). Combine peppers, adobo sauce, garlic, cumin, oregano, salt, pepper and 3 tablespoons of broth in a food processor. Process until smooth and set aside. At this point you can use a slow cooker or your oven. If using your oven, preheat to 300 F. Place (smoked or regular) brisket in a slow cooker insert or roasting pan. Spread the chipotle sauce on top of brisket and pour the remaining broth around the sides. If using the oven, cover roasting pan tightly with foil. For both oven and slow cooker, cook (on low setting of your crockpot or at 300 F in the oven) for 8-10 hours, until brisket shreds easily with a fork. Remove brisket from pan onto a large platter or cutting board. Shred with two forks (be careful, its hot!). Moisten the shredded meat with some of the sauce. You probably need to use at least half of the juices. For a spicier taco, reduce pan juices by boiling them in a pot on the stove for 10-20 minutes, and use all of the juices to moisten the meat. Serve on warm tortillas with sour cream, cilantro, diced purple onion, salsa and a squeeze of lime juice! *I can usually buy a half brisket (8-12 pound size) at the local packing plant and save half for later. This freezes very well, so dont worry if you can only find a large piece of brisket.",

In a large skillet, heat the oil and then saute the eggplant peels, skin side UP, by covering the pan and cooking over moderate heat about five minutes, or until the pulp is lightly browned. Remove the slices and allow them to cool slightly. Arrange them in a one and a half quart round baking dish star fashion, with the narrow end in the center of the bowl and the wide end hanging over the top edge; the five pieces of peel should be equidistant from each other and should overlap in the bottom.

Mix the ground lamb with the paprika and tomato paste and, if you like some salt and pepper. Wet your hands, and, little by little, press the lamb onto the bowl, on top of the peels and without disturbing the pattern formed by the peels; the inside of the bowl should be completely covered with the lamb mixture, though it need not come all the way to the rim of the bowl.

Increase oven temperature to 425F (after removing roast from oven) and continue to bake stuffing, uncovered, until top is crisp, 15 to 20 minutes more. Transfer pork to a platter and let stand 30 minutes. Transfer pan juices from roasting pan to a gravy separator or a glass measure and skim off fat. Straddle roasting pan across 2 burners, then add wine to pan and boil over high heat, stirring and scraping up brown bits, until reduced by about half, about 5 minutes. Add reserved onion mixture, broth, pan juices, and any juices on platter from roast and bring to a simmer. Restir cornstarch mixture and add to pan, whisking, then simmer 2 minutes. Add butter and swirl pan until incorporated. Season with salt and pepper. Carve pork and serve with stuffing and sauce.",

Continue to stir so that the mixture wont stick to the pan. For the caramel layer: In a microwavable bowl, add the caramels and the whipping cream. Warm them up in the microwave for a minute at a time and stir until it is creamy. For the chocolate later: Melt the chocolate chips. I used the double boiler method where I placed the chip on the boiler and melted them until the chocolate was creamy. You can use whatever method you like to melt the chocolate. For the peanut and toffee layer: In a food processor or chopper, chop peanuts but do not chop them into a powder. You just dont want them to be bulky. Place peanuts and toffee in a bowl for dipping. For the assembly: Dip the pretzels in the nougat. It may seem as though the nougat is not sticking to the pretzel but keep dipping and it will and then place them on a cooling rack and allow to cool for 10 minutes. Once they are cooled, dip them in the caramel and place back on the cooling rack and allow to cool for another 10 minutes. Note: You can take a butter knife and clean up the excess dripping off the pretzels for a cleaner look. Finally, dip in the chocolate and roll the pretzel into the peanut and toffee and place back onto the cooling rack. Allow to cool completely for 25-30 minutes before eating. Enjoy!",

Continue mixing until butter is combined and the mixer looks like little bread crumbs. On low speed, mix in water until the dough starts to come together. Divide dough in half. Shape each half into a ball and wrap in plastic wrap. Place dough balls in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. Remove one dough ball (for the bottom crust) from refrigerator and roll dough out on a lightly floured surface. Shape dough into whatever size you need for your pie dish. Put dough into pie pan and flatten out, making sure there is enough dough hanging over the edges. (Dough can be put in the freezer and kept for up to 2 months. When you are ready to use dough, take the dough out of the freezer and place in the refrigerator overnight. Dough should be soft enough to use that next day.) For the filling: In a small bowl, mix together Splenda, flour, and cinnamon. Pour cinnamon mixture into a large bowl with the apples. Toss until all the apples are coated with the cinnamon mixer. Pour apple mixture into the pie dish and spread out apples so they are evenly distributed in the pie pan. Sprinkle butter pieces over apples. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Roll out the remaining dough ball and place over the apple mixture. Press down the bottom dough over the top dough and make loops for the edge of the crust. Take a knife and make 4 slits on top pie dough Place pie onto a cookie pan (one with sides) because the apple pie might boil over. Bake for 40-50 minutes or until crust becomes golden brown.

Mix in the mixer or with a hand held mixer for about 2 - 3 minutes, or until the dough is smooth. It should be a bit thicker than cake batter. Refrigerate 1 hour so that the dough sets up. (This will give you time to clean up a bit. ). Once dough has set up a bit, drop it in spoon-fulls onto a greased cookie sheet, or a cookie sheet that uses pan liners. Don't put more than 12 on a cookie sheet. Try not to over cook them. BAKE: 375 Degrees. TIME: 10 minutes. *Bake, and once removed from the oven, let cook for about 10 minutes before you frost them. Once you have frosted them, you can eat them right away, or later. These are truly yummy! FROSTING DIRECTIONS: Make sure that the butter/margarine is soft before you start. Add all ingredients and mix for about 2 minutes until frosting is smooth. You may have to add more hot water by the teaspoon to get the frosting to the right consistency, or more powdered sugar. The frosting should be a thick glaze consistency. I usually double this recipe so that I have enough frosting. (My kids like more frosting! ).",

        "instructions": "First, how to make Mrs. Adachi's teriyaki sauce. Combine the soy sauce and mirin in a pan over high heat. When it comes to a boil, turn the heat down to low, and simmer until the liquid has reduced to half its original volume. That's it. Stick a disposable chopstick in vertically to measure the liquid level. It's easier to gauge when it's reduced to half this way. Skim off any scum too. Now, to make the stuffed squid, first use a piece of ginger that's about this size. Use the teaspoon next to it for scale. Peel the ginger. If you scrape it with a spoon, it should come off cleanly. Slice half of the ginger thinly, and julienne the rest to make 'ginger needles.' Soak the julienned ginger in water, then drain. We'll use the body of the squid only. I used a 24 cm long Surume squid (remove the tentacles) this time. See below for instructions on how to prep the squid. Optional: If you have a sweet tooth, prefer the rice to be sweet, or if serving this to children, mix in 1 to 2 teaspoons of the teriyaki sauce (not listed). Wash the squid body well, pat the outside and the inside dry, and stuff with rice. Stuff it completely, including the pointed tip. Secure the opening with toothpicks. Put the flavoring ingredients in a pan over high heat. We'll cook everything over high heat. When the sauce is boiling properly, put in the stuffed squid. Roll it around the pot. After a minute or so, add the thinly sliced ginger. Keep rolling the squid around the pot. In a few minutes, the sauce will start to thicken. It should bubble up with big bubbles as shown in this photo. Add the mirin. Shake and swirl the pan to coat the squid with the sauce very well. When the sauce looks thick and sticky, it's done! Turn the heat off and leave the squid to cool in the sauce. When it has cooled down a bit, slice into any thickness you like. If you rinse the knife blade after every cut, each slice will be neat and clean. Serve with the julienned ginger! To see how to prepare a squid, please take a look at my method, described in.

Five minutes before mixing is complete, add the reserved sliced strawberries and mix in completely. When this process is complete, the ice cream will have a soft, creamy texture. Remove it from the ice cream maker and place into an airtight freezer container and freeze for about 2 hours. Yummola!",

Top with remaining phyllo sheet, pressing down gently, then brush with remaining butter. Chill phyllo 10 minutes. Trim edges of phyllo with a sharp knife to make 1 (15- by 12-inch) rectangle. Cut stack lengthwise to make 4 (3-inch-wide) strips, then cut strips crosswise into 5 (3-inch) squares, forming 20 total. Halve each square diagonally, then carefully transfer triangles, 1 at a time, with a spatula onto a parchment-lined large baking sheet, spacing them 1/4inch apart. Cover triangles with another piece of parchment and a baking sheet (as a weight). Bake in lower third of oven until golden, 15 to 18 minutes. Remove top baking sheet and carefully peel off top parchment (some phyllo may stick to it), then cool crisps on baking sheet on a rack. Beat cream in a bowl with an electric mixer until it holds soft peaks, then gently fold in lemon curd. Put 1 crisp on each of 8 plates. Top each crisp with 1 heaping tablespoon mousse, then layer with another crisp and tablespoon mousse. Top with crisps. Sprinkle reserved chopped nuts around napoleons.",

Just cut deep enough to cut the outline of the cookie. There is no need to plunge the details of the cookie cutter into the cookie dough yet, well do that later with the fondont. Slide the wax paper with the cookie cutouts onto a sheet pan and refrigerate for at least 5 minutes until the dough is firm enough to handle without distorting the cookies when you transfer them to a sheet pan for baking. Remove baking sheet from the refrigerator and transfer cookies to a silicone mat-lined sheet pan, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Bake for about 10 minutes. While the cookies are in the oven, roll the fondant to a thickness of 1/8-inch between two layers of wax paper. Use the same plunge cutter to make fondant shapes that match the cookies in the oven, but this time use the plunger to plunge the details into the fondant. Slide the sheet of waxed paper onto a baking tray and put it into the refrigerator to chill for a couple minutes. After the cookies have been removed from the oven and have cooled for about 5 minutes, top each with a fondant cutout, allowing the residual heat of the cookies to fuse the two together.

Spoon the mixture into the prepared cake pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 28-35 minutes. A wooden skewer inserted in the middle should come out with almost no crumbs attached, and the middle of the cake, when pressed, should spring back slightly instead of sink. Bake for an additional 5-10 minutes if necessary. Remove from the oven and let cool in the pan for 10 minutes. Slide a table knife all around the edge to loosen the cake, then remove from the pan.

        "instructions": "Into a microwave-safe bowl, pour in the milk, add butter and microwave for 30 seconds at 600W (high) without covering with a lid or plastic wrap. Take out the bowl from Step 1, and with a whisk, mix the butter until it is well incorporated into the milk. Add the dry yeast and mix some more. Add 1/3 of the amount of flour, sugar, and salt, and mix until the batter is smooth. Add the remaining flour, and 1/3-1/2 the amount of beaten egg and mix with a chopstick (Save the remaining egg for later). Continue mixing with a chopstick, so the dough comes together. Once the dough from Step 5 has come together, cover with parchment paper, and microwave for 30 seconds at 150-200W (low). Allow the dough to rise. Let the dough rest for 10 minutes. Bubbles will form during this time. Use the parchment paper covering the dough to de-gas the dough with your hands. Divide the dough into your preferred portions, form them into balls and place on a sheet of parchment paper. Cover your dough from step 9 with a sheet of parchment paper and lay a damp, tightly wrung out kitchen towel on top. Let the dough rest for 10 minutes at room temperature. Leave the sheet of parchment paper on top and gently de-gas the dough with your hands. Form into your preferred shapes (At this point, you can add your favorite toppings or fill the dough with your desired fillings). Cover the dough with parchment paper, microwave for 30 seconds at 150- 200W (low). This will be the 2nd rising. Keep the parchment paper covered and lay a damp cloth on top. Allow the dough to rise at room temperature for 10 minutes. Pre-heat the oven to 190C. If the dough has risen 1.5 times it's original size the 2nd proofing is completed. Glaze the dough with the beaten egg you have set aside. Bake in the pre-heated oven for 10-15 minutes, and you're done (This is an old photo, so excuse me for the not-so-perfect shapes haha). Simple bread rolls. This dough is very simple so it goes well with any kind of topping. This picture shows an-pan (sweet bean buns) and wiener sausage bread.",

Add more ice water, one tablespoon at a time, until the dough begins to stick together. If it gets too sticky, add a small amount of flour. Whole wheat flour requires less water than all purpose flour, so err on the side of less water at first. When the ingredients are well combined, turn the dough out onto a piece of plastic wrap. Wrap it and gently press into a 1 thick cake. Refrigerate for 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. After it has thoroughly chilled, gently roll the crust out into a circle 2 larger than the diameter of your pie dish. The edges will split due to the delicate nature of this crust. Dont despair.

Size) Instant Dry Active Yeast,1- 1/4 cup Water,13 cups Sugar,1 Tablespoon Cinnamon,4 cups Water,1/4 cups Honey",
        "instructions": "For the cream cheese: Put softened cream cheese, crushed walnuts, honey, brown sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, and a pinch of salt into your stand mixer and mix until all the ingredients are fully incorporated and creamy! I like to add a pinch of salt to balance out the sweetness of all the other ingredients! Store this in an airtight container in the fridge until ready to use! For the bagels: Start by making the dough. Place bread flour, brown sugar, salt, vegetable oil, and instant yeast into a mixing bowl. Set this aside while you warm your water. You use warm water to active your yeast. Look on your yeast packet for the temperature they suggest to activate it. Mine said 110 F, but different brands may suggest a different temperature. Once your water is the appropriate temperature, mix this into the dry ingredients. Attach a bread hook to your standing mixer and mix for 8 10 minutes on low. When ready, the dough will be completely engulfing the hook and nothing will be sticking to the sides of the bowl. Today, I decided to make these bagels with a cinnamon swirl, but this step is optional. You could skip this step and top your bagels with your choice of topping later on! Combine sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl. Spread cinnamon sugar mixture onto your kitchen counter and knead the dough into it a few times until the cinnamon sugar is well incorporated into the dough! Try to knead as little as possible, as you dont want to overwork your dough! Once your dough is ready, lightly mist a large bowl with cooking spray and place the dough in the bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let dough rest for an hour and a half. The dough will rise significantly. After the 90 minutes, roll out the dough onto the counter and cut into 6 8 equal pieces. I cut my dough into 6 pieces and it made 6 giant bakery style bagels. Feel free, however, to make 8 smaller bagels, although you may need to adjust the cooking time listed below. Once you have 6-8 equal pieces, roll these into balls and place onto a baking sheet lined with a silicone mat. Let these rest for 20 minutes. Now, using your finger, poke a hole into the center of each roll. Gently open the hole about an inch by gently pulling the hole apart. Next get your water bath ready. The water bath is a really crucial step to making really chewy bagels! Bring the water to a boil in a large pot and then add the honey. The honey also helps with the chewiness of the bagels. Once the water is boiling and the honey has been added, gently drop in one bagel at a time and cook for 60 seconds. Then flip the bagel over and cook for another 60 seconds. Use a slotted spoon to remove the bagel from the water and set aside. Repeat with the remaining bagels. Preheat an oven to 425 F and bake these on another silicone mat lined baking sheet for about 20 minutes or until the tops are lightly golden and the bagels are cooked through! In the last few minutes, keep an eye on these so the tops dont get too brown. Remove from oven when done. Place bagels on a cooling rack to completely cool!",

        "ingredients": "200 grams Dark chocolate,100 grams Heavy cream (35% butterfat),2 tsp Earl Grey tea leaves,2 tsp Mizuame syrup or honey,20 grams Unsalted butter,1 Pure cocoa powder",
        "instructions": "Finely chop up the chocolate and add it to a bowl. If you choose to melt the chocolate in the microwave beforehand, you can just break it into blocks instead. Place the cream, mizuame and tea leaves into a saucepan and heat it up until the mixture is just about to come to a boil. Take care to turn off the heat before it boils, however. Strain the mixture from Step 2 into the bowl from Step 1 and use a rubber spatula to melt the chocolate into the cream mixture. Lastly, mix in the butter. Pour the mixture from Step 3 into a tray lined with baking paper or cling film and leave the mixture to chill and set in the refrigerator. Once chilled, take the truffles out, cut into your desired size, and dust with cocoa powder. If you warm up your knife before cutting, the cut will be neater. If the truffles are too soft to cut properly then cut them after chilling them in the freezer. Please keep an eye on the chocolate if you are melting it in the microwave. The butter and mizuame is added to achieve a melt-in-the-mouth texture. If you want these truffles to come out the best that they can be, then I sincerely recommend adding both of these ingredients. Addendum: if you are using low-fat cream, please increase the amount a little or the truffles may come out too hard I changed the photo for this recipe (this photo shows some slightly thinner truffles). If you use the amounts listed above then you can make some thicker truffles. Please adjust the thickness of the truffles to your taste. I recommend these truffles as presents. You can use milk chocolate instead of dark chocolate if you'd prefer. A mix of dark and milk chocolate is also delicious.",

        "instructions": "1 To make the filling, place the chicken breasts and onion in a medium saucepan and add enough cold water to cover by 1 inch. Add 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, uncovered, until the chicken is cooked through, about 15 minutes. Remove the chicken from the saucepan and let cool completely. Tear the chicken into shreds. 2 Mash the avocado, mayonnaise, and vinegar together in a medium bowl with an immersion blender or large fork until smooth. Stir in the cilantro, parsley, jalapeno, and garlic. Add the chicken, red pepper, red onion, and scallion and mix together. Season with salt and pepper. Taste and add more vinegar to give the filling a pleasant, but not sour, tang. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve. 3 To make the arepas, stir 3 cups lukewarm water and the salt together in a large bowl to dissolve the salt. Gradually add 3 cups cornmeal, mixing with your fingers to dissolve any lumps, adding enough to make a soft dough that holds its shape without cracking when molded. Set dough aside to rest for 3 minutes. Add the oil and work it in with your hands, adding cornmeal or water to return the dough to the proper consistency. 4 Divide the dough into 6 equal portions. Shape each into a 4-inch diameter disk, about 1 inch thick. Transfer to a baking sheet. 5 Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 350F. Lightly oil a large nonstick skillet or griddle and heat over medium heat. 6 In batches, place the arepas in the skillet. Cook until the underside is a splotchy golden brown, about 4 minutes. Turn and brown the other side. Return arepas to the baking sheet. 7 When all of the arepas are browned, transfer them directly to the oven rack (without the baking sheet). Bake until the surfaces of the arepas have formed a taut skin-if you rap your fingers on one, it will feel and sound like a drum. Return arepas to the baking sheet and let cool slightly.

Drizzle 2 tablespoons of the water and vinegar mixture into the dough and stir, using a wooden spoon or rubber spatula. Add more water, a tablespoon at a time, until the dough holds together to form a soft ball. Take care not to knead the dough too much. Divide the dough in two. Press each half into a disk about an inch thick and place each disk between two 14-inch long pieces of waxed paper. Using a rolling pin, roll each piece into a circle about 1/4-inch thick. For a more even, uniform circle of dough, roll the pin one or two strokes outward, turn the dough a few degrees, and roll a few times again and repeat. Repeat with the other half of the dough. Refrigerate the rolled dough wrapped in waxed paper until it is ready to use, or as directed in the recipe.",

After the rice has cooked, place it into a large shallow bowl, and sprinkle the rice vinegar/sugar over the top of the rice. Very important, do not stir the rice after adding the rice vinegar/sugar mixture. Cut and fold it as if you were adding flour to egg whites. You dont want to mash the rice, just make sure the rice vinegar is incorporated into the rice. Use the bamboo paddle or a large flat wooden spoon and make sure that the shallow bowl you put the cooked rice in is big enough that you can do the cut and fold without doing a rice mash. Its best to do this while the rice is still warm as it absorbs the vinegar best this way. Cut the avocado into slices at this point and place aside. I cut the avocado in half, twist it a little and pop it apart. Then I use a thin paring knife, and slice lengthwise into the avocado, stopping at the skin. Run the thin knife around the edge of the avocado, and just pop out the slices. Or slice it however you want. After peeling it, that is. First, place a sheet of plastic wrap on top of the bamboo rolling mat. Sprinkle a thin layer of the toasted sesame seeds on top of the plastic. Then put a thin layer of rice on top. About a half a cup or so. I like a thin layer of rice. Wet your hand and keep a bowl of water beside you. Pat down the rice with your wet hand. Dont mash the rice down, just pat it into place. Its sticky enough that it will do just fine. (This is very important. You need to keep your hands wet, otherwise the rice sticks to everything.) Next place a sheet of Nori on top of the rice and then add your fillings, some avocado and some crab or the spring onions and grated carrot mixture. I usually make 3 California Rolls, and then two of the other kind. I like putting the Nori on the outside of the roll when I fill it with vegetables like the grated carrot, spring onion and cucumber. Roll the sushi roll using the mat and that plastic wrap. Pick up the edge of the wrap thats closest to you, roll away from yourself keeping the wrap firm. Continue until the whole thing is in a nice roll. This does take a little practice and if you screw up the first one, you can always save it and eat it a little later on. Pat the roll and shape it a little so its nice and round. Place in the refrigerator. Continue with the next sheet of Nori, the second roll is a lot easier to do. I can usually get three California Rolls out of one can of crab. Continue using the rest of the rice and Nori. I alternated by putting a sheet of Nori down first, placing a thin layer of rice on that with some of the grated carrot and green spring onions. You can also use matchstick sliced cucumbers if you know your guests can handle the cucumbers. When all the rolls are done, refrigerate them until you are ready to serve. Then take each roll out and slice into thin slices. I find each roll will make about 8 slices. And heres the final hint. Cut each roll in half and then slice each of the halves in half again, and then slice each of those halves in half again. You should have 8 even slices at this point. Serve with some wasabi, soy sauce, sesame seeds and pickled carrots.",

        "title": "Betty Crocker's Baking Powder Biscuits (Light, Flaky and Tender)",
        "ingredients": "2 cups all-purpose flour,1 tablespoon granulated sugar,4 teaspoons baking powder,1 teaspoon salt,12 cup shortening,34 cup milk",
        "instructions": "Preheat oven to 450F degrees. Sift flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt together in medium bowl. Cut in shortening using pastry blender (or pulling 2 table knives through ingredients in opposite directions), until mixture looks like fine crumbs. Stir in milk until dough leaves side of bowl (dough will be soft and sticky). Place dough on lightly floured surface. Knead lightly 10 times. Roll or pat 3/4 inch thick. Cut with floured 2 1/2 -inch round cutter. Place on ungreased cooked sheet about 1 inch apart for crusty sides, touching for soft sides (I prefer crusty sides). After cutting as many biscuits as possible, lightly press-dont knead- the scraps of dough together to make 1 to 2 more biscuits. Bake 10 to 12 min or until golden brown. Serve warm. Note: This recipe doubles very well. Every time that I make these, I always double this recipe. To double, simply double all the ingredients. Also, the key to high-rise, flaky biscuits is having really fresh baking powder and not overworking the dough. Even if your baking powder is not expired, the biscuits will not rise if the baking powder has clumps inside the container. Also, I cannot emphasize enough to just lightly knead the dough 10 times; over-kneading will produce a tough biscuit. When you pat the dough to 3/4 inch thickness, the baking powder will already be activating the dough to rise. Do not re-pat the dough down again because the air bubbles forming will make the biscuits flaky. Betty Crocker's Tips for Biscuits: Tip One: One secret to making flaky biscuits is thoroughly blending or \"cutting in\" the shortening and dry ingredients. A pastry blender, which breaks the shortening into little lumps works great for cutting inches If you don't have one, you can crisscross two table knives through the flour and shortening or use a wire whisk. Tip Two: Use a biscuit cutter dipped in flour to cut the dough, pushing the cutter straight down through the dough. If you twist as you cut, the biscuits will be uneven. Cut the biscuits as close together as possible. If you don't have a biscuit cutter, use the end of an open 6-ounce juice can or other narrow can or glass, or use cookie cutters for fun shapes. Dip in flour before cutting.",

Heat the butter and oil in a large nonstick pan, pour in the egg mixture, and cook until just set on the bottom. (Watch your hob heat). Place the pan under the heated grill element, only until the eggs are lightly set on top. Remove the pan from the oven. Spread with the tomato sauce, and sprinkle with the fried bacon, olives, mushrooms, cheddar and mozzarella. Grill until the cheese melts. Cut into 6 wedges to serve. PS: It might be a better idea to lightly fry the mushrooms with the bacon, instead of using them raw, as the recipe says. And please add seasonings to your taste. I haven't tried this recipe yet, but it looks like a very practical solution for a light, meat-free meal.",

        "title": "Sarasota's Green Chili Mexican Burger",
        "ingredients": "4 hamburger buns (don't use those small store bought rolls in a package, get a nice hearty roll),1 13 lbs ground turkey (1/3 lb per burger),2 tablespoons grated onions,3 tablespoons salsa (don't use the extra chunky kind, and use hot, med or mild, depending on how spicy you like it),1 12 teaspoons chili powder,1 teaspoon cumin,salt,pepper,8 slices monterey jack pepper cheese (2 per burger, and take advantage of the deli, purchase what you need rather than a whole block),1 avocado, cut in thin wedges (2-3 per burger),8 lettuce leaves,34 cup mayonnaise,1 (4 ounce) can green chilies, minced,12 garlic clove, minced,1 teaspoon lime juice (I use 1 fresh lime, the remaining lime I squeeze over the avocado so it doesn't brown)",
        "instructions": "Mayonnaise -- In a small bowl, add the green chilies mayonnaise, garlic and lime juice and mix well. If you want, you can blend this in a small food processor or blender, but I actually like a little texture to mine. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use. This can easily be made ahead of time. Burgers -- In a medium size bowl, add the salsa, chili powder, cumin, grated onion (and yes grate the onion right over the bowl, the juice is important), pinch of salt and pepper. If you use a mild salsa you can add a bit more chili powder, but I use a medium heat salsa which works just fine for this. Mix everything well. Then add in the turkey and mix lightly, I prefer to use my hands; and make sure not to over work the burgers. Make 4 nice size burgers and place on a small sheet pan lined with either foil or parchment. Make a small indentation in the center of the burger with your thumb. Not too deep, just a little indent; this helps the burger not to shrink up as it grills. Season with salt and pepper and put in the freezer. We are not freezing them, just firming them up. They cook better after they rest a bit and are chilled. About 15-20 minutes in the freezer. These also can be made a head of time. Garnish -- Prepare your avocado slices and drizzle with the remaining lime juice (just so they doesn't brown), lettuce leaves and cheese. Grill -- I prefer an outside grill, but a inside grill pan or even a heavy saute pan will work just fine. Spray the pan or grill with a non stick spray and cook the burgers on the first side until you get a nice sear and golden brown, depending on how thick you make them, about 5 minutes. Flip, and make sure when you flip, the burger releases from the pan or grill easily. If you have to scrape to flip it, it isn't ready to be flipped. The second side again will take about 5 minutes, maybe a bit less. Add 2 slices of cheese per burger and melt. As the cheese melts, add the burger rolls either to a broiler or grill to lightly brown. Finish -- Top the bottom bun with a thin slather of the mayonnaise, then a lettuce leaf; then the burger with melted cheese, another lettuce leaf, avocado slices and top with the second bun slathered with the mayonnaise. Serve -- ENJOY! A crisp green salad goes great with this; fries of course or chips and a pickle.",

        "instructions": "Wash your potatoes thoroughly. Then take them and cut them in half. Then take the halfed potato and cut it longways down the middle. Then begin slicing it along the width into what would look like little triangle shapes into your desired thickness. (NOTE: Remember the thicker than you cut them the longer they will take to cook, but you don't want to cut them so thin that they cook up really crispy like potato chips.) Next begin by cutting the ends of the onion and off. Peel the first layer of the paper like peel/outer-skin off of the onion. Then take the onion and slice it in half width ways. Now with the round side up and the flat portion on your cutting board ,begin cutting at an angle starting from the end into Julienned slices. (NOTE: The thickness should be about an 1/8 of an inch) repeat this step with the other piece of the onion. Heat large deep skillet/ or WOK over medium heat and add/melt half or your butter. Once the butter is melted begin sauteeing your onions. Stir frequently and cook until they are almost fully cooked and a bit translucent. Once they are cooked remove them and place them in a bowl to be used later. If you are handy with a WOK you can use it to flip/stir your onions. Now add the remaining butter to the skillet until melted. Then add in your potatoes ,pepper ,and garlic salt. Stir potatoes frequently/ or if using a WOK flip them frequently! Once the potatoes are pretty tender and almost cooked thoroughly ,take and add in the sauteed onions from the bowl that you cooked earlier. Once the onions are added keep stirring and cook an additional 10 minutes until everything is cooked thoroughly. If you like your potatoes a little crispy you can stop stirring and let the bottoms of the potatoes brown but make sure to be careful not to burn them. The last step is to remove from heat and place on a plate with a paper towel to absorb some of the grease and butter. Once they have cooled a bit and drained you can eat no ketchup needed! Add more pepper garlic salt if needed to enhance flavor!",

        "instructions": "Preheat the oven to gas 5 / 190C/ 375F Grease an 8\" or 9\" round tin with spray oil Mix the flour, starch, salt, sugar and xanthan gum in a bowl Add the applesauce and coconut oil, warmed milk and yeast. Mix together to form a soft dough It should be more batter-like, a very soft dough, not sticky but not dense at all. If you made a ball of it and dropped it on counter top it would flatten a little. Don't be tempted to add more flour thinking that the dough is too soft Mix the sugar and cinnamon from the topping ingredients together and sprinkle 2 tablespoons of it into the greased tin Make balls out of the dough about 2 inches in diameter or enough dough to fit in the palm of your hand Spray the doughnuts with the oil and sprinkle liberally with the cinnamon sugar Place them in a single layer in the tin At this point you can bake as they are for 18 - 20 minutes then let cool for in the tin for 5 minutes. Lovely doughnuts! Invert onto a serving plate and enjoy. Any leftovers can be frozen for up to 3 months. Just defrost then warm through in the oven at the same temp for 4 minutes to refresh them If you want the caramel sauce topping to make the doughnuts into monkey bread, melt the leftover cinnamon sugar with just over 3/4 it's weight of butter in a pan until the sugar has dissolved Pour over the coated doughnuts and bake for 25 - 30 minutes Let cool in the tin for 10 minutes to let the caramel sauce thicken then invert onto a serving plate It's probably better to make the balls half the size if doing this, around an inch wide, just because of the sweetness",
