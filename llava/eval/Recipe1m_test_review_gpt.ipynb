They should be nice and light golden brown when done. Peel off the skin from the pumpkin pieces until you have a big pile of the stuff. If you have a food processor, throw in a few chunks at a time. A blender will work, too, if you add a little water. Or you can simply mash it up with a potato masher, or move it through a potato ricer, or process it through a food mill. Pulse the pumpkin until smooth. If it looks too dry, add in a few tablespoons of water during the pulsing to give it the needed moisture.

Once hot, add ginger and garlic and saute until fragrant, 2-3 minutes. Add jalapeno, vegetable broth, and green onions. Cover and simmer 10-15 minutes. While broth is simmering, in a separate pot, cook soba noodles according to package directions. Drain and set aside. (These are cooked separately to keep your nice broth from getting murky!) Strain broth into a large bowl. (This step is optional, but I prefer to remove the solids.) Once strained, pour broth back into pot. Add soy sauce, rice vinegar, vegetables, and tofu, and simmer until veggies are heated through, 1-2 minutes. Add soba noodles and heat for 1 more minute, until both noodles and broth are hot. Remove soup from heat and ladle into bowls. Serve alongside sliced green onions, chopped cilantro, and Sriracha. Note: This soup is best eaten immediately, as it wont reheat well once the vegetables and noodles have been added. If youre planning to have leftovers, I recommend saving half the broth just after straining and before adding anything else. For leftovers, you can assemble the bowl of soup just before reheating, to avoid having mushy veggies and noodles.

Turn it around so that the flesh side is facing upwards and cut a slit along the side of the loin, without cutting all the way through, to open it out like a butterfly. Cover the flesh with the lemon zest, sage and parsley leaves, then scatter over the garlic. Season generously with salt and pepper and drizzle over with a little olive oil. Roll up the loin and secure tightly with kitchen string in 3-4cm intervals. Rub the scored skin with a large pinch of salt, drizzle with a little olive oil and sprinkle with another pinch of salt.

Whisk together the all-purpose flour, cocoa powder, baking soda and salt. Set aside. 2. Using a handheld mixer or a stand mixer with the paddle attachment, beat the butter with the two sugars until creamy, about 2 minutes. Scrape down the bowl, and add the egg, milk, and vanilla extract, and beat together until combined. 3. Add the food coloring into the creamed mixture, and mix until combined. Scrape down the bowl once more, and add the flour mixture. Turn the mixer to low, and mix until the cookie dough is just combined. (Over-mixing can make the cookies tough and give them a strange texture.) A very soft dough will be formed. Mix in 1/2 cup of the white chocolate chips and mix just until combined. 4. Cover the dough and chill for 1 hour and up to 3 days. Chilling is mandatory. (You can also scoop the dough before chilling; see note.) 5. Preheat oven to 350 F. Line two baking sheets with silicone baking mats or parchment paper. 6. Scoop the cookies out onto the parchment paper using a large ice cream scoop (see note) spacing them at least a couple inches apart. Gently press the cookies down using the palm of your hand (you can wear a glove to keep everything clean). Using the remaining 1/4 cup white chocolate chips, gently press 4 or 5 into the tops of each cookie. 7. Bake the cookies for 12-14 minutes, until they have spread out and look puffy. Remove from oven. Let them cool on the baking sheet for 10 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. Enjoy! Notes: 1. I like to weigh my flour and sugar because it saves time and gives a very accurate reading. If you bake a lot and want to have your flour and sugar properly measured, I highly recommend buying one. 2. Let the egg come to room temperature by setting it out with your butter for at least an hour, or place the egg in a bowl of warm water for 10-15 minutes. 3. I like to scoop my dough before I chill it because Ive found that chilled dough can be really hard to scoop. This dough was a little sticky to scoop out, but wearing gloves really helps. 4. I like using large ice cream scoops when baking cookies because they bake up really big like bakery cookies. I just bought a cheap one at the grocery store for $4 or $5. 5.

Can) Low Sodium Chicken Broth,3 whole Large Eggs,1 cup Flour, Or More As Needed,1/4 cups Olive Oil,3 whole Lemons,1 teaspoon Salt,1 teaspoon Freshly Ground Black Pepper,3 Tablespoons Butter .I Use Salted,1/4 cups Chopped Fresh Parsley.\\nInstructions: Trim chicken breasts of any fat. Take each breast and flatten it out with a mallet. If the breasts are very thick, you will want to filet them before pounding them out thin. I had four thick breasts, which I had to filet and then pound out thin. Set the chicken to the side and then prepare your work station for dipping and flouring. Crack the eggs into a shallow bowl and beat together well. You can add a teaspoon of cool water to the eggs to help thin them out a bit. In a separate shallow bowl, add your flour and season with your salt and pepper. Stir to combine. Dip each chicken breast first in the flour, then the egg, and then the flour again, pressing to make sure you get a nice even coat. Set each breast on a plate until you finish dipping and breading each one. Set the oven to 350 degrees. In a non-stick skillet, add 2 tablespoons of olive oil and set the heat to medium. Once hot, add two chicken breasts at a time and cook until just done on each side. You want them to be a very light golden brown. We are not looking for a deep brown color to these. Continue adding 2 tablespoons of olive oil for each 2 chicken breasts you brown. Cook each breast until just about done. Remove to a casserole dish and continue browning each chicken breast. Once you are done, place the casserole dish with the chicken in the oven uncovered and allow to cook for 10 12 minutes. Meanwhile, wipe out the skillet with some paper towels. You dont want to clean the pan completely, but you do want to remove all that flour that has browned in the bottom. You wont remove the flavor by doing this, but you will allow yourself to have a nice lemon colored sauce. Set the burner to medium heat and pour in your chicken broth. Add some salt and pepper if you feel it needs it. Squeeze in the juice of two lemons. Bring to a bowl and then quickly whisk in about 1 teaspoon of flour. Add in the butter and whisk again. Turn the heat down to simmer and allow to reduce to almost half. Once the sauce is done, add the chopped fresh parsley and stir. Set the chicken breasts out on a rimmed platter or baking dish, and pour the sauce all over the top of each breast. Take your last lemon and slice it thin, with the skin on. Place pieces of sliced lemon across the whole dish and serve..', 'dish name: Peppered Herb-Yogurt Dressing.\\nIngredients: 1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon plain whole-milk yogurt,1 teaspoon coarsely cracked black peppercorns,1/2 teaspoon very finely chopped garlic,3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil,1/4 cup chopped mixed herbs, such as chives, dill and tarragon,Kosher salt.\\nInstructions: In a bowl, whisk together the yogurt, black peppercorns, garlic and 2 tablespoons of water.

Put meat into a large non-corrosive baking dish or pan. PREPARE THE MARINADE/GLAZE: Heat a griddle or large cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Tear chiles into flat pieces and toast a few at a time, pressing them against the hot surface, until they crack and blister; flip them and press down again. Transfer chiles to a large bowl and cover with boiling water; weight down with a plate to keep them submerged, and soak at least 30 minutes. Meanwhile, roast the garlic in the same griddle or skillet, turning frequently, until soft inside and blackened outside, about 15 minutes. Cool and peel. Drain chiles, reserving 3/4 cup soaking liquid; put chiles into a blender with garlic, cloves, sesame seeds, vinegar, cumin, peppercorns or ground pepper, and salt. Process/blend until mixture is smooth; then strain through a medium-mesh sieve into a bowl. Remove 1/2 cup of mixture to a small bowl, and stir in the sugar; set aside to use for the final glazing. MARINATE THE MEAT: Spread the rest of the chile paste thoroughly over the meat. Cover completely and refrigerate at least 18 hours. COOK (SLOW-STEAM) THE MEAT: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. Use a deep wide roasting pan that has a tight lid. Put a roasting rack into the bottom of the pan (it must sit at least 1 inch above the bottom of the pan---if not, prop it up with custard cups, tin cans, etc.) Measure in 4 cups of water. Then lay the marinated meat onto the rack and spread any marinade remaining in the marinating pan or dish. Cut a double thickness of heavy-duty foil to cover the roasting pan; place the pan lid over, making sure the pan is covered as tightly as possible. Bake 4 hours. FINISHING THE BROTH: Remove the pan lid and foil; carefully remove the tender meat to a platter. Take out the rack; spoon the fat off the broth with a ladle. Measure out the broth into a 1-quart container; add water to equal 1 quart liquid if necessary, and pour into a saucepan. Puree the tomato in a blender and add it to the broth along with the oregano and cinnamon. Cover; simmer over medium-low heat 45 minutes. Season with salt. GLAZE THE MEAT: Heat oven to 375 degrees. Remove meat from the bones, keeping pieces of meat as large as possible; discard bones, gristle and excess fat. Set meat on a baking sheet; brush lightly with reserved chile paste glaze, and bake 10 minutes to set the glaze. TO SERVE: Keep tortillas warm in a towel-covered basket. Serve the broth in a tureen. Present the meat on a large platter, or slice meat across the grain to serve it in deep plates, awash in the broth.

Pour everything into an oven proof dish, which needs to be big enough to hold the chicken in just one layer with a little space between the pieces. Add the chicken to the oven dish and turn the pieces well so that all sides are covered with the marinade. Leave the chicken skin side down and place the wedges and sprigs of thyme in between the pieces. Allow to stand for half an hour. Preheat oven to 190C/375F/Gas 5.

Add the water and mix to form a dough. Knead the mixture for about 5 minutes, until it forms a smooth ball. Set the dough aside and cover with a damp cloth. Let it rest for about an hour. In a small bowl, mix all your sauce ingredients. After the dough has rested, cut the dough in half and leave one half under the damp cloth. Put the other section of dough onto a large, lightly floured work surface. Use a rolling pin and roll it into a big rectangle, as thin as you can get it. Rub about half a tablespoon of oil all over the surface of the dough and sprinkle with half of the chopped scallions, salt, and sesame seeds (if using). Cut 2 slits on each long side of the dough (cut about 1/3 of the way into the center of the dough but dont cut all the way across the rectangle). See related blog link for step-by-step photos. With the rolled out dough oriented vertically (the short side near you), start at the bottom and fold the two side flaps of dough over the middle piece. Then fold that entire rectangle forward onto the middle level. Then fold the next set of flaps over, and repeat. When you have your nice, neat rectangle of folded dough, take your rolling pin and roll it until almost doubled in area. Take care not to roll too firmly, as you dont want the dough layers to bind and you want to keep some small pockets of air between them. Heat a couple tablespoons of oil in a pan over medium heat and add the pancake. Cover the pan and cook for about five minutes on each side, or until golden brown. Transfer to a cutting board, slice, and serve with your dipping sauce.

Pat dry with a paper towel. In a large lidded pot, add about 1/4 cup of olive oil and turn the heat to high. Once the pot gets hot, add the meat and brown on all sides. Preheat your oven to 300 degrees. Remove the meat from the pot and set aside. Remove some of the oil from the pot, but not all of it. Leave about 2 tbsp. in there. Cut the white onion into large chunks and run 4 or 5 large cloves of garlic through a microplane or garlic press. Let the onions and garlic cook for a bit. Then add the chicken stock. Make sure you use stock, not broth. Next, add the wine. I like to use a dry wine like Chianti or Burgundy. Throw in 3 large bay leaves and then add the meat back into the pot. Use butchers twine and tie the sprigs of rosemary and thyme together and add to the pot too. Create an airtight seal between the lid and pot by lining the pot with parchment paper, then placing a sheet of aluminum foil under the lid. Ok folks, the trick to making melt-in-your-mouth, cut-with-a-spoon pot roast is to cook this baby slow and low. Put the pot in the oven for 3 1/2 hours on 300 degrees. Once done, remove the pot from the oven. Take the meat and set aside. Run the liquid through a sieve and only keep the liquid. Discard the bay leaf, herbs and onions. Dont worry, well add fresh ones in a minute. Put the liquid back in the pot and add the meat. Coarsely chop the red onions, and run 4 garlic cloves through your microplane. Add to the pot. Next, take a lemon, and wash it off. Using your microplane, take the zest of the lemon and add to the pot. Cut the lemon in half and add the juice to the pot. Adding the lemon juice and zest really brightens the flavor of this dish. Add the carrots. Chop up 1/4 cup of parsley and add to the pot. Also, add a few thyme leaves. In a small cup, mix 1/3 cup of water and arrowroot, then add this mixture to the sauce to thicken up a bit. Lastly, add the tomato paste into the pot and whisk into the sauce. Let the carrots and onions cook on med-high heat. Transfer to a platter to serve. Top with freshly chopped parsley and a little lemon zest for garnish. You can serve this with some mashed potatoes and some garlicky green beans..', 'dish name: Grilled Corn Pesto.\\nIngredients: 4 ears Fresh Corn, In Husks,1 cup Parmesan Cheese, Shredded,1/2 cups Almonds, Toasted,3 cloves Garlic,2 Tablespoons Fresh Lemon Juice,1/4 cups Fresh Parsley, Chopped,1/2 cups Fresh Basil, Chopped,Salt And Pepper, to taste,1/4 cups Olive Oil, Or More To Taste.\\nInstructions: To grill the corn: 1. Over medium heat, place the corn (in their husks!) on the grill, directly over the flames. Turn the corn every 2-3 minutes, when the husks begin to blacken. The silk or ends of the husks might catch fire as they dry out. I think this adds an amazing smoky flavor to the corn, but if youre scared (chicken! ), just make sure to trim those bits off before you put them on the grill. (Practice proper safety! Always use long tongs when handling the corn, and keep your digits away from the flame.) 2. When the husks are good and charred and the kernels are mostly cooked, remove the corn from the grill and place it in a pan or bowl you have standing by until it cools down a bit. Carefully peel back and remove the husks, watching out for any trapped hot steam. Place the naked ears (teehee!) back on the grill and turn every 1-2 minutes, or until as many kernels as possible have browned and caramelized. Brown equals sweet flavor! 3. Remove the corn from the grill, and when it is cool enough to handle, cut the kernels from the cob. Once youve removed the kernels, scrape the back of your knife along the cob to really get all the creamy corn bits out of there. To make the pesto: Blend the corn and all the remaining ingredients in a food processor, minus the olive oil. When the ingredients are well blended, with the food processor running, stream in the olive oil until a thinned out sauce forms. Add enough olive oil until your desired consistency is reached. Serve over pasta, meat, or shredded vegetables. * Note: You can toast almonds in the oven at 350 degrees F for a few minutes or in a dry pan over low heat. Just cook them until you can smell their oils releasing. I use my toaster oven.

Lastly, add white chocolate chips and mix in. 5. Using a 2 ice cream scoop, scoop out nice even amounts of dough and space then on your tray about 1.5 apart. This is going to make HUGE cookies. (Use a smaller scoop and decrease the baking time, if you want smaller cookies) Just remember, these cookies will bake and spread out quite a bit. Bake about 16 minutes for a chewier cookie, 18 minutes for a crispier one. Again, if using the said 2 scoop. ** Always check your cookies a few minutes before said baking time because everyones oven temperature is a little different. Theyre done when theyve flattened out a little and have a nice crispy top with cracks. 6. Let cool and enjoy!

Shape each into a ball or loaf and place on a parchment-lined baking sheet (try not to handle the dough too much at this point).

Size) Reames Frozen Egg Noodles,1 can (14 Oz. Can) French Style Green Beans,6 ounces, weight Neufchatel Cream Cheese.\\nInstructions: Start with a 6-quart pot. Add between 1 and 2 quarts of water to boil your chicken. In the meantime, start chopping the vegetablesdice up your onion, carrots and celery. By the time youre finished with this, your chicken should be close to done. My chicken breasts usually only take about 20 minutes at a rolling boil; check it to make sure. Remove your chicken from the water (stock) youve just boiled it in, and set it aside to cool for a few minutes. Turn heat down to just a simmer, add the veggies you just chopped and let simmer for 2030 minutes. While the veggies are at work, start shredding your chicken. This takes forever no matter how many times Ive done it before. Once your chicken is all shredded, add the chicken broth, salt, pepper and chicken to the pot. Turn the heat up and bring back to a low boil. Once everything is back to a low boil, youll finally add the good stuff! Toss in Reames egg noodles and green beans. Stir frequently for about 35 minutes; the egg noodles can get weird and stick together, but its only happened to me once. Now for the last, and best part of all: the cream cheese. Youll want to put it in the soup in clumps, about 12 tablespoons or so. Thats just an estimate though, dont get technical, just eyeball it. As you drop your clumps in, push them below the surface so theyre entirely submerged. We want it to melt nicely. No need to stir much, youll just make it separate and look really strange (again I did this the first couple times I made this and it turned out weird-looking, but tasted great). It takes about 5 minutes to melt entirely. The end. I usually leave this to simmer, as low of a setting as I can, for 13 hours. Just depends how far in advance Ive made it. This soup is thick and hearty, great with sourdough. It becomes very thick like a casserole in a couple of hours, and then can be eaten with a fork! Hope you enjoy!.\", 'dish name: From-Scratch Cinnamon Rolls.\\nIngredients: 1/2 cups Whole Milk,1/4 cups Water,2 Tablespoons Unsalted Butter,2- 1/4 teaspoons Instant Yeast,2 Tablespoons Granulated Sugar,2- 1/2 cups All-purpose Flour, Plus An Additional 1/2 Cup If Needed,1 teaspoon Salt,1 whole Large Egg,3 Tablespoons Unsalted Butter, Softened To Room Temperature,1 Tablespoon Ground Cinnamon,1/2 cups Granulated Sugar,1- 1/2 cup Confectioners Sugar,1 Tablespoon Vanilla Extract,3 Tablespoons Whole Milk,Seasonal Sprinkles (optional).\\nInstructions: For the rolls: In a small saucepan, combine the milk, water, and unsalted butter. Heat over low heat, until the butter has melted and the mixture has reached 110 degrees F. Sprinkle the yeast on top and allow to activate for 10 minutes. Once the yeast has activated (it will start to foam), sprinkle in the sugar. Add the yeast mixture to the bowl of a stand mixer, with dough hook attached. Add in flour and salt, and knead on low until a soft dough forms. Add the egg and continue to knead until the dough starts to pull away from the sides and form a ball around the dough hook. If you find that the dough is too runny, add the remaining 1/2 cup of flour. Knead on medium speed for 4 minutes and then transfer the dough to an oiled bowl to rest for 15 minutes. (Note: If you dont have a stand mixer with dough hook, you may use a food processor with dough blade. You may also go old school and knead with your hands.) Generously flour a work surface and roll the dough into a 15x10 inch rectangle. For the filling, take the unsalted butter and spread it onto the dough. If you need/want more, then feel free to add more. Combine the cinnamon and sugar in a small bowl then sprinkle on top of the butter. Roll the dough into a log, starting at the longest edge (the 15-inch edge). Roll tightly, making sure to not crack the dough. With the seam side down, slice the dough into 12 equal-sized pieces. Grease a 9-inch pie dish, and lay the rolls, cut side down, into the pie dish. Cover loosely, and place the rolls in a warm place (I like to use my oven, turned off). Let rise for 1 1/2 hours to 2 hours, or until the rolls have doubled in size. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F and bake rolls for 25-30 minutes, covering them halfway through if they start to brown too much. Remove from heat and allow to cool slightly while you prepare you glaze. For the glaze: In a medium bowl, whisk together the confectioners sugar, vanilla extract and whole milk until smooth and no clumps remain. Drizzle the glaze on top of the rolls and sprinkle with sprinkles if desired. Serve warm or store in an airtight container where they will keep for 3-4 days.

The brine is simple: mix 1/2 cup kosher salt and 2 tbsp. sugar in a gallon of water. I recommend lining a large pot or bucket with a plastic bag first, then adding the chicken, tying the bag to prevent any leaks. You can brine for as little as an hour to as long as overnight. In this case, I brined the chicken for about five hours. After removing the chicken from the brine, give it a thorough rinse and pat dry with paper towels.

Prepare the aioli. In a food processor, combine 13 of the minced garlic, 1 teaspoon of the chili paste and the egg yolks. Start the food processor and after a few seconds, very slowly drizzle in all of the olive oil until blended. Add the roasted red pepper and pulse until smooth. Transfer to a non-metal bowl, cover and set aside. 2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the remaining minced garlic, 1 tablespoon of the Asian chili paste, the lemon juice and rice vinegar. Add the prawns and stir to coat with the mixture. Transfer the contents of the bowl into a zippered storage bag and refrigerate for 30 minutes. 3. Heat a large saute pan over medium heat. Remove the prawns from the marinade and set aside. Add the marinade to the pan and heat until it begins to simmer. Add the prawns and poach for 2 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and then turn the prawns over to finish cooking another 1 minute off the heat. Serve the prawns alone or on a bed of sesame fire noodles with a dollop of the aioli on top and more on the side for dipping. Tips and trending: If you have concerns about using raw egg yolks in the aioli, combine 13 of the garlic, the chili paste and the roasted red pepper with 1 1/2 cups of mayonnaise. Keep covered at room temperature while you prepare the prawns. Poaching shrimp instead of boiling produces much more tender results. Try poaching shrimp this way the next time you prepare some for a salad or shrimp cocktail. Smaller shrimp are easy to overcook, so set a stainless steel bowl in an ice bath, remove the cooked shrimp from the poaching liquid and toss them around in the ice cold bowl to halt the cooking. Then put the shrimp in a zipper storage bag and refrigerate until ready to use..', 'dish name: Basic and Easy Creamy Roasted Red Pepper Soup.\\nIngredients: 6 large roasted red peppers, chopped (from a jar saves time),1 large onion, diced,3 small garlic cloves, chopped,1 tablespoon butter,18 teaspoon black pepper,1 (28 ounce) can diced tomatoes with juice,1 cup water,1 vegetable bouillon cube (I use mushroom),1 cup heavy cream (I use 35% whipping cream),salt, if necessary.\\nInstructions: Add butter to large saucepan and melt over medium heat. Add onion and garlic and saute for about 4 minutes, just to get the aromas flowing. Sprinkle mixture with black pepper. Add roasted red pepper and cook for another couple of minutes. Pour in the can of diced tomatoes with juice and raise heat. Pour in cup of water and add bouillon cube. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. Once bouillon cube has dissolved add cream and stir, removing from heat. *Give the soup a quick taste to see if salt is needed. Generally the bouillon cube is salty enough so you will probably not need it. Transfer small amounts of the soup into a blender, trying to keep an even liquid to vegetable ratio. Puree until there are little to no chunks left and pour into another saucepan. Continue this until all the mixture is pureed, leaving you with a hearty, thick soup. **If you want to freeze batches, do not add the cream. Puree the soup as normal, omitting the cream and add cream at a later time when the soup is defrosted. ***I use heavy whipping cream because I love the rich taste. If you want to cut back perhaps use only 3/4 cup or use a lower cream altogether. I find the heavy cream gives the soup a nice texture. ****Instead of using water and a bouillon cube you could always use store bought broth..', \"dish name: Quick & Cheesy Sausage Rotini.\\nIngredients: 3 cups rotini pasta, uncooked,1 lb.

Mine is a Bosch, with dough hooks. Let this sit until the yeast is bubbly. While that is happening prepare the shortening. Scoop the shortening into your glass measuring cup, and soften it in the microwave for about a minute. Dont make it too hot and liquid-ey or you will kill the yeast that you are preparing. Next, add the shortening, the remaining sugar, salt, and another cup of warm water to the yeast mixture. Use your mixer to combine all the ingredients. Just get them mixed up, they really dont have to be smooth. Finally, add the eggs and the remaining cup of warm water. Add one cup of flour at a time after you start your mixer. The dough needs to be pretty sticky, so dont use too much flour. When youre done scraping all the flour into the bowl without sending up a flour dust cloud, set the timer for 10 minutes and set your mixer on knead. This is very important you need to make sure you knead that dough for a full 10 minutes. Strangely enough, I have done this so many times that I can hear the gluten in my dough activate because the sound of the machine changes, and not more than another minute goes by and then the timer goes off. Spray a large bowl with non-stick spray and get the dough out of your mixing bowl. Because your dough is sticky, use a spatula and scrape it out into your large mixing bowl. Sprinkle the top of the dough with a bit of flour, and cover with a towel. Place the bowl of dough in the refrigerator and allow to chill overnight if you can. I like mine to chill but I never have more than 4 hours to give it. The dough handles and performs better when chilled. If you dont have the time, it still all works out. Go straight to preparing the dough. Now, to make your croissants, have a pizza cutter ready, and 1/2 cup of butter completely melted in a bowl. Divide the dough in the bowl into four equal sections. Take 1/4 of the dough out onto a floured surface and with a rolling pin, smooth the dough out into a circle about the size of a pie crust. Pour a fourth of the melted butter on top of the first dough section and spread it to the edges, covering equally. With the pizza cutter, cut the circle of dough into eight pie-shaped pieces. Roll each piece from the wide end to the center point (thus creating your crescent rolls). Move rolls to a baking sheet, and curl the points in just a bit towards each other. Repeat with each triangular piece of dough. Repeat the whole process over with the other three sections of dough and the rest of the butter until you have 32 rolls on your sprayed baking sheets. I need three baking sheets for this recipe. Cover your rolls and baking sheets with a towel and allow them to raise to a nice fluffy size. Bake in a preheated oven at 350 degrees F for 8 minutes or just until golden brown.

Many instructed you to either boil a few chicken breasts and shred them or use canned shredded chicken. Canned chicken reminds me of tuna and Spam ... And both of those are not favorites in my house. So I decided because I am always running late I would try something else instead of boiling a few breasts myself. I use precooked fajita chicken strips. I know ... Im such a rebel. So anyway, lets get this show on the road. Start by setting your oven to 350 F. Take the chicken strips, warm them in a skillet as directed on the package. Once these are warm, you can either chop them finely or you can throw them in a food processor. Now that you have your chicken chopped up, put it into a large bowl and mix it together with all of the ingredients, reserving 1/2 cup of the cheese for the topping. Pour the dip into an oven safe dish and bake for 20-25 minutes at 350 F.

Start by adding the warm water, yeast and sugar into the bowl of a stand mixer. Stir just to combine. Set aside to bloom. Combine the pumpkin puree, melted butter, eggs and salt in a separate bowl. Stir until fully incorporated. After the yeast has had 10 minutes to bloom, add the pumpkin mixture to it and stir until combined. Add 5 cups of flour and turn on the mixer fitted with the dough hook. Mix until combined. Press your finger into the dough to test it. If it is still sticky, add the remaining 1/2 cup of flour. The dough should be soft but not sticky. Place the dough in a large bowl that you have sprayed with cooking spray. Cover it with a sheet of plastic that youve sprayed with cooking spray and put it in the fridge overnight. Check on it before you go to bed, I had to punch mine down as it was overflowing the bowl. The next morning, remove the dough from the refrigerator and place it on the counter (still in the bowl). Take the stick of butter (for the frosting) and place in a medium skillet on medium high heat. Melt the butter, stirring it constantly until little brown flecks appear on the bottom. Once that happens immediately remove pan from the heat and set aside to cool. Next, work on the filling. Combine the brown sugar, butter and cinnamon in a large bowl until it creates a paste. Set aside for now. Heavily dust your rolling surface with flour. Plop the dough in the middle and roll it out to about 30x16. Sprinkle the filling onto the dough and smoosh it down with your fingers. Starting with one of the long ends, roll the dough up as tightly as you can into a log. Using a sharp knife score and slice the log into rolls. Mine were about 2 inches thick. Place the rolls in a greased 9x12 baking dish. Let the rolls rise in a warm place for an hour and a half to two hours. Preheat the oven to 350 F. Once oven is heated, place the rolls in the oven for 15-20 minutes. Mine baked for 20 minutes. Test by pressing down in the middle of a roll. It shouldnt sink. While the rolls are baking, work on the frosting. In a medium bowl, combine the cream cheese, cooled brown butter, powdered sugar and half-and-half. Mix with a hand mixer until fully combined. Remove the rolls from the oven and liberally spread the frosting over them. En-freaking-joy.

Stir the yeast into the milk and let it sit for about 3 minutes. Add the butter and sugar to the milk and stir to mix. Add the flour to the milk, about 1 cup at a time and add the fine salt as you add the flour. Mix w/ a spoon. Knead for about 10 minutes with a stand mixer, or by hand. Put kneaded dough in a greased bowl and cover with greased plastic wrap. Let rise for 1 hour in a moist, warm place until doubled in size. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees . Punch down dough and divide into 12 lumps -- this is easiest if you divide it in half, cut each half into three lumps, then cut each lump in half. Combine the warm water and baking soda in a shallow dish (e.g. and 8x8 baking dish); stir/whisk until the baking soda is as dissolved as possible. Roll all 12 lumps of dough out as thin as you can -- they will shrink up quickly so getting the thinnest ropes possible is key.

Grease a 8x8 in. casserole dish with softened butter our spray with nonstick cooking spray, set aside. In a large sauce pan cook macaroni according to package directions, drain in colander and set aside. In the same sauce pan, melt butter with olive oil over med heat. The olive oil helps prevent browning of the butter. Stir in chopped onion and cook until translucent, stirring occasionally. About 2 minutes. Add flour stirring with whisk constantly for about 2 minutes more (to cook flour). Gradually pour in half and half, whisking constantly. Stir in salt, pepper and cayenne. Bring to a low boil and continue boiling for 2 minutes. Still whisking constantly. You must use half and half to truly accomplish a rich, creamy sauce. You could use milk if you want, but milk alone just doesn't cut it. Reduce heat and gently simmer (stirring constantly, you guessed it) for 10 minutes to thicken. Add shredded cheese a handful at a time. Whisking to incorporate each addition. Simmer, stirring, an additional 5 minutes, or until all cheese is melted. Turn off heat. Return macaroni to sauce pan and gently fold into cheese sauce. Adjust seasoning to taste. I usually need to add a little more salt once the pasta is added (up to another 1/2 tsp), and sometimes add extra cayenne if we want a little extra kick. Transfer to casserole dish. Now is where you add the topping if you want a little crunch. In a small bowl toss panko breadcrumbs with olive oil to coat. Sprinkle over top of mac n cheese. Bake, uncovered, 20 minutes or until top is golden brown and edges are bubbly. Notes: It is important to use extra sharp cheddar (or a mixture of sharp, strong cheeses) in order to really taste the cheese. Milder cheeses are not strong enough to truly provide a rich, cheesy flavor. I like using Kraft Shredded Triple Cheddar with a touch of Philly. If I feel like shedding my own I will get a block of good quality Vermont extra sharp white cheddar. If you want it extra, super cheese add up to an extra cup of cheese to your sauce. It's ok. I won't tell. ;-) Substitutions and mix-ins: you can sub 1/4 cup sliced leeks for the onion, or omit this ingredient completely (although I say keep it). Can also sub nutmeg for cayenne, these brighten all the flavors and bring it all together (i would not use both). For variations in flavor, mix in about 4 slices crispy, crumbled bacon or 1/2 cup frozen spinach, thawed and drained with all excess liquid squeezed out when you sure in pasta..\", 'dish name: Audreys Pork Tenderloin.\\nIngredients: 1/2 cups Dry Sherry Wine (More Or Less),1/2 cups Soy Sauce,2 cloves Garlic, Minced,1 Tablespoon Dry Mustard,1 teaspoon Ground Ginger,1 teaspoon Dried Thyme,2 whole Pork Tenderloins,1 jar Red Currant Jelly,1 Tablespoon Soy Sauce,2 Tablespoons Dry Sherry Wine (More Or Less).\\nInstructions: Whisk the first six ingredients in a bowl. Combine the pork tenderloin and the marinade mixture in a Ziploc bag. Refrigerate for up to 24 hours. (I buy the huge packages of pork tenderloin at the warehouse store and freeze two of them in the marinade for future use. It defrosts and marinates at the same time!) Prepare your grill for direct grilling. When the grill is hot, clean and oil your grates. Grill the pork tenderloin for 4 minutes on each of the 4 sides. After about 15 to 16 minutes, the temperature on an instant read thermometer should be 140 degrees F. When the temp reaches 140 F, remove the tenderloins from the grill and tent on a platter with foil. Let rest for about 5 minutes. While the meat is resting, combine the currant jelly, 1 tablespoon soy sauce and 2 tablespoons sherry in a small sauce pan. Simmer over medium heat until the jelly is melted and the mixture is combined thoroughly, about 3 to 4 minutes. Serve the sliced pork tenderloin with the currant jelly sauce. NOTE: I use the minced ginger that comes in the jar, sort of fresh, and I also use fresh thyme. This recipe has measurements for dried spices. If you use fresh, double the amount for more flavor..', 'dish name: Homemade Breakfast Sausage.\\nIngredients: 1 teaspoon Table Salt,1 teaspoon Sugar,1/2 teaspoons Black Pepper,1/2 teaspoons Dried Parsley,1/2 teaspoons Rubbed Sage,1/4 teaspoons Ground Marjoram,1/4 teaspoons Dried Thyme,1/4 teaspoons Red Pepper (optional),2 teaspoons Water,1 pound Ground Pork Or Ground Turkey.\\nInstructions: In a medium bowl, combine all of the ingredients except the ground pork or turkey. Whisk until the spices are moistened. Add the ground pork or turkey and stir until thoroughly combined (I use my hands). If you have time, cover the sausage and refrigerate for a couple of hours to allow the flavors to meld. If you dont, the sausage will still taste great. To cook, form the sausage into patties (or crumble if making sausage gravy). Cook over medium heat until the sausage has nicely browned on both sides. Notes: 1. I love this with ground turkey! I prefer ground turkey with a mixture of white and dark meat so the cooked sausage isnt so dry. 2. Buying ground pork from the grocery store is a big time-saver. However, it can sometimes be hit or miss. Commercially ground pork averages about 70% lean meat. Ground pork can come from various parts of the pig so you really never know what youre getting. If you have a grinder or food processor (or a nice butcher! ), grind your own pork so you know what cuts are going into the sausage. 3. For an ULTRA low-fat version: Buy some pork tenderloin on sale and trim off all of the fat. I cut it into 1 cubes (1 pound of pork after trimming) and freeze it in single layer on a sheet pan for about 20 minutes or so. The outside should be firm but the inside should be pliable. While the pork is freezing, combine the other ingredients in a small bowl and whisk to combine. Sometimes, I substitute vegetable oil for the water (shhhhh!) when using this method so it is not as dry. Transfer the pork to a food processor and dump the herb mixture on top. Whiz the pork (scraping down the bowl as necessary) until it is as finely/coarsely ground as you like. Pork tenderloin is similar to a boneless, skinless chicken breast in fat content so this preparation is great for someone who wants pork sausage on a low-fat diet. As with many other ground, low-fat proteins, this ultra low-fat version can get a little dry and spongy when cooked. The flavor is great if you dont mind a drier sausage with a slightly spongy texture. Its not my favorite way to make it but I offer this as a very healthful alternative. 4. I, personally, like the clean taste of white sugar in sausage. Feel free to substitute brown sugar or maple syrup if thats your thing..', 'dish name: Silky Vegan Pumpkin Pie.\\nIngredients: 10 ounces silken tofu firm,15 ounces pumpkin puree (canned),1/2 cup date sugar,13 cup vegetable oil,2 tablespoons molasses,1 teaspoon vanilla extract,2 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon ground,1 teaspoon nutmeg,1 teaspoon allspice,1/4 teaspoon ginger,1 each pie shell (9 inch).\\nInstructions: Blend all ingredients, pour into pie shell and bake for 1 hour and 350F (180C). or until done..', 'dish name: Red Cabbage Slaw with a Twist.\\nIngredients: 3 cups thinly sliced red cabbage,3/4 cup diced red bell pepper,2 shallots, diced,1 (1 inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and minced,10 leaves fresh basil, snipped,1/4 cup mayonnaise,1 lemon, juiced,2 tablespoons olive oil,1 1/2 teaspoons wasabi paste,freshly ground multi-colored peppercorns to taste,1/4 cup toasted pine nuts,2 tablespoons salted sunflower kernels.\\nInstructions: Combine cabbage, red bell pepper, shallots, ginger, and basil in a large bowl.

Stir with wooden spoon until shortening is nearly melted & just has a couple tiny, pea-sized lumps floating around (approx 120 degrees on candy thermometer). Pour hot mixture into mixer bowl with yeast & flour, add both eggs & begin mixing on low to medium speed til mixture is all wet. Begin slowly adding spoonfuls of flour & mixing until dough forms into ball around the dough hook & bottom of mixer bowl is no longer sticky with wet dough. Ball of dough will be slightly smooth & spring back when touched with fingertip. Remove dough from hook & bowl & form into ball with hands. Spray inside of bowl with non-stick cooking spray & then drop dough ball into bowl with the smooth side down. Then turn ball over so the seam side is now down. (This greases top & bottom of ball). Cover mixer bowl with it\\'s lid,a towel or foil & place in warm area to rise for about an hour. Dough will be about double the starting size in an hour.

Sprinkle the yeast into the water, stir to mix, and pour over the cornmeal mixture. Mix with your fingers, pressing the mixture into the sides, bottom, and corners until all of the flour is wet and fully incorporated. Cover the container and let sit at room temperature for 10 to 14 hours. The starter will be at its peak at around 12 hours. Stir together the white flour, cornmeal, sugar, salt, and yeast in a medium bowl. Pour about one-third of the water around the edges of the starter to release it from the sides of the container. Transfer the starter and water to an extra-large bowl along with the remaining water and the bourbon. Using a wooden spoon, break the starter up to distribute it in the liquid. Add the flour mixture, reserving about one-sixth of it along the edge of the bowl. Continue to mix with the spoon until most of the dry ingredients have been combined with the starter mixture. Switch to a plastic bowl scraper and continue to mix until incorporated. At this point, the dough will be just slightly sticky to the touch. Push the dough to one side of the bowl. Roll and tuck the dough, adding the reserved flour mixture and a small amount of additional flour to the bowl and your hands as needed. Continue rolling and tucking until the dough feels stronger and begins to resist any further rolling, about 8 times. Then, with cupped hands, tuck the sides under toward the center. Place the dough, seam-side down, in a clean bowl, cover the top of the bowl with a clean kitchen towel, and let rest at room temperature for 30 minutes. For the first stretch and fold, lightly dust the work surface and your hands with flour. Using the plastic bowl scraper, release the dough from the bowl and set it, seam-side down, on the work surface. Gently stretch it into a roughly rectangular shape. Fold the dough in thirds from top to bottom and then from left to right. With cupped hands, tuck the sides under toward the center. Place the dough in the bowl, seam-side down, cover the bowl with the towel, and let rest for 30 minutes. For the second stretch and fold, repeat the steps for the first stretch and fold, then return the dough to the bowl, cover with the towel, and let rest for 30 minutes. For the third stretch and fold, gently stretch the dough into a rectangle. Pinch the butter into pieces, distributing them over the top of the dough. Using your fingers or a spatula, spread the butter across the surface of the dough. Roll up the dough tightly from the end closest to you; at the end of the roll the dough will be seam-side down. Turn it over, seam-side up, and gently press on the seam to flatten the dough slightly. Fold in thirds from left to right and then do 4 or 5 roll and tuck sequences to incorporate the butter. Turn the dough seam-side down and tuck the sides under toward the center. Return the dough to the bowl, cover with the towel, and let rest for 30 minutes. For the fourth and final stretch and fold, repeat the steps for the first stretch and fold, then return the dough to the bowl, cover with the towel, and let rest for 20 minutes. Line a half sheet pan with a linen liner and dust fairly generously with the dusting mixture. Lightly dust the work surface and your hands with flour. Using a bench scraper, divide the dough into 2 equal pieces. Press each into a 7-inch (18 cm) square, then roll into a loose tube about 7 inches (18 cm) long Let rest for 5 minutes. Press each piece out and then shape into a very tight tube 9-10 inches (23 to 25 cm) long. Using a bench scraper, make 3 to 5 cuts on the diagonal down the loaf. Then, make 3 to 5 cuts in the opposite direction, crossing the first set of cuts, to make diamonds. Transfer to the lined pan, cut-side down, positioning the loaves lengthwise. Dust the top and sides of the dough with flour. Fold the linen to create support walls on both sides of each loaf, then fold any extra length of the linen liner over the top or cover with a kitchen towel. Transfer the pan to the refrigerator and chill for 16-22 hours. Set up the oven with a baking stone and a cast-iron skillet for steam, then preheat the oven to 480 degrees F (250 degrees C). Using the linen liner, lift and gently flip the loaves off the pan and onto a transfer peel cut-side up. Slide the loaves, still cut-side up, onto a dusted baking peel. Working quickly but carefully, transfer the loaves to the stone using heavy-duty oven mitts or potholders. Pull out the hot skillet, add about 3 cups of ice cubes, then slide it back in and close the oven door. Immediately lower the oven temperature to 440 degrees F (225 degrees C). Bake, switching the positions of the loaves about two-thirds of the way through baking, until the surface is a deep, rich brown, with some spots a long the scores being very dark (bien cuit), about 28 minutes. Using the baking peel, transfer the loaves to a cooling rack. When the bottoms of the loaves are tapped, they should sound hollow. If not, return to the stone and bake for 5 minutes longer.

First boil the water and then put it in the pitcher. Then add the package of gelatin. Stir, or shake, if your container has a tight fitting lid, to dissolve. Add cold water or equivalent amount of ice, fruit juice, and then liquor. Definitely use ice instead of the cold water if you are having the party in less than 4 hours because it will solidify faster. Taste to ensure there is enough liquor and consider adding more. If you use a citrus juice then you can add more liquor. Do NOT use pineapple juice, it will interfere with the gelatin setting. Pour the mixture into 3 oz Dixie cups, filling 2/3 full (after all, you want enough of these to go around). I normally lay down a sheet of wax paper, and then pour the cups and place them on a cookie sheet. If you do two batches you can place the cookie sheets on top of each other in the fridge. Drop small fruit slices or an individual berry into each shot cup for a classy touch. Then chill for at least 3 hours. To bring them to your friend's party, find a cardboard box.

Combine the soy sauce and mirin in a pan over high heat. When it comes to a boil, turn the heat down to low, and simmer until the liquid has reduced to half its original volume. That\\'s it. Stick a disposable chopstick in vertically to measure the liquid level. It\\'s easier to gauge when it\\'s reduced to half this way. Skim off any scum too. Now, to make the stuffed squid, first use a piece of ginger that\\'s about this size. Use the teaspoon next to it for scale. Peel the ginger. If you scrape it with a spoon, it should come off cleanly. Slice half of the ginger thinly, and julienne the rest to make \\'ginger needles.\\' Soak the julienned ginger in water, then drain. We\\'ll use the body of the squid only. I used a 24 cm long Surume squid (remove the tentacles) this time. See below for instructions on how to prep the squid. Optional: If you have a sweet tooth, prefer the rice to be sweet, or if serving this to children, mix in 1 to 2 teaspoons of the teriyaki sauce (not listed). Wash the squid body well, pat the outside and the inside dry, and stuff with rice. Stuff it completely, including the pointed tip. Secure the opening with toothpicks. Put the flavoring ingredients in a pan over high heat. We\\'ll cook everything over high heat. When the sauce is boiling properly, put in the stuffed squid. Roll it around the pot. After a minute or so, add the thinly sliced ginger. Keep rolling the squid around the pot. In a few minutes, the sauce will start to thicken. It should bubble up with big bubbles as shown in this photo. Add the mirin. Shake and swirl the pan to coat the squid with the sauce very well. When the sauce looks thick and sticky, it\\'s done! Turn the heat off and leave the squid to cool in the sauce. When it has cooled down a bit, slice into any thickness you like. If you rinse the knife blade after every cut, each slice will be neat and clean. Serve with the julienned ginger! To see how to prepare a squid, please take a look at my method, described in.

Just cut deep enough to cut the outline of the cookie. There is no need to plunge the details of the cookie cutter into the cookie dough yet, well do that later with the fondont.

Take out the bowl from Step 1, and with a whisk, mix the butter until it is well incorporated into the milk. Add the dry yeast and mix some more. Add 1/3 of the amount of flour, sugar, and salt, and mix until the batter is smooth. Add the remaining flour, and 1/3-1/2 the amount of beaten egg and mix with a chopstick (Save the remaining egg for later). Continue mixing with a chopstick, so the dough comes together.

Bubbles will form during this time. Use the parchment paper covering the dough to de-gas the dough with your hands.

Add cold, cubed butter. Using a pastry cutter (or two knives), cut in the butter until it is in pieces about the size of a green pea or smaller. Add 3 tablespoons of water and stir the dough with a wooden spoon. Add more ice water, one tablespoon at a time, until the dough begins to stick together. If it gets too sticky, add a small amount of flour. Whole wheat flour requires less water than all purpose flour, so err on the side of less water at first. When the ingredients are well combined, turn the dough out onto a piece of plastic wrap. Wrap it and gently press into a 1 thick cake. Refrigerate for 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. After it has thoroughly chilled, gently roll the crust out into a circle 2 larger than the diameter of your pie dish. The edges will split due to the delicate nature of this crust. Dont despair.

Lay the crust over your pie dish and crimp the edges. Lay a large piece of aluminum foil over the crust and shape it to fit the dish. Add pie weights, if you have some, or just raid your childs bag of glass marbles! Bake for 20 minutes. Carefully remove the foil and weights to a heat-proof container to cool.

Use a sharp knife to make a lengthwise cut about 1 inch from the edge of the meat, slicing down but not cutting through. Open the meat flat along the cut. Keeping the knife parallel to the cutting board, continue to slice the roast open so you can unroll it into a large, flat piece. (You can also ask your butcher to butterfly the roast for you.) When the meat is unrolled, make small slashes through any connective tissue or extra-thick parts so the roast is as even in thickness as possible. Drizzle cut surface with 2 teaspoons olive oil. Rub oil into meat and generously season with 2 teaspoons kosher salt, black pepper, sage, rosemary, orange zest, garlic, and crushed fennel seeds. Press seasonings in firmly with your hand, roll up the pork roast, and tie the roast in several places with kitchen twine.

Size) Instant Dry Active Yeast,1- 1/4 cup Water,13 cups Sugar,1 Tablespoon Cinnamon,4 cups Water,1/4 cups Honey.\\nInstructions: For the cream cheese: Put softened cream cheese, crushed walnuts, honey, brown sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, and a pinch of salt into your stand mixer and mix until all the ingredients are fully incorporated and creamy! I like to add a pinch of salt to balance out the sweetness of all the other ingredients! Store this in an airtight container in the fridge until ready to use! For the bagels: Start by making the dough. Place bread flour, brown sugar, salt, vegetable oil, and instant yeast into a mixing bowl. Set this aside while you warm your water. You use warm water to active your yeast. Look on your yeast packet for the temperature they suggest to activate it. Mine said 110 F, but different brands may suggest a different temperature. Once your water is the appropriate temperature, mix this into the dry ingredients. Attach a bread hook to your standing mixer and mix for 8 10 minutes on low. When ready, the dough will be completely engulfing the hook and nothing will be sticking to the sides of the bowl. Today, I decided to make these bagels with a cinnamon swirl, but this step is optional. You could skip this step and top your bagels with your choice of topping later on! Combine sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl. Spread cinnamon sugar mixture onto your kitchen counter and knead the dough into it a few times until the cinnamon sugar is well incorporated into the dough! Try to knead as little as possible, as you dont want to overwork your dough! Once your dough is ready, lightly mist a large bowl with cooking spray and place the dough in the bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let dough rest for an hour and a half. The dough will rise significantly. After the 90 minutes, roll out the dough onto the counter and cut into 6 8 equal pieces. I cut my dough into 6 pieces and it made 6 giant bakery style bagels. Feel free, however, to make 8 smaller bagels, although you may need to adjust the cooking time listed below. Once you have 6-8 equal pieces, roll these into balls and place onto a baking sheet lined with a silicone mat. Let these rest for 20 minutes. Now, using your finger, poke a hole into the center of each roll. Gently open the hole about an inch by gently pulling the hole apart. Next get your water bath ready. The water bath is a really crucial step to making really chewy bagels! Bring the water to a boil in a large pot and then add the honey. The honey also helps with the chewiness of the bagels. Once the water is boiling and the honey has been added, gently drop in one bagel at a time and cook for 60 seconds. Then flip the bagel over and cook for another 60 seconds. Use a slotted spoon to remove the bagel from the water and set aside. Repeat with the remaining bagels. Preheat an oven to 425 F and bake these on another silicone mat lined baking sheet for about 20 minutes or until the tops are lightly golden and the bagels are cooked through! In the last few minutes, keep an eye on these so the tops dont get too brown. Remove from oven when done. Place bagels on a cooling rack to completely cool!.', 'dish name: Simple Sausage Rolls.\\nIngredients: 250 g beef ground sausage,3 tablespoons tomato sauce (in the USA its ketchup),1 small onion,4 tablespoons mixed herbs,1 pinch salt,3 sheets puff pastry,little milk to spread over pastry dough.\\nInstructions: 1.

Once chilled, take the truffles out, cut into your desired size, and dust with cocoa powder. If you warm up your knife before cutting, the cut will be neater. If the truffles are too soft to cut properly then cut them after chilling them in the freezer. Please keep an eye on the chocolate if you are melting it in the microwave. The butter and mizuame is added to achieve a melt-in-the-mouth texture. If you want these truffles to come out the best that they can be, then I sincerely recommend adding both of these ingredients. Addendum: if you are using low-fat cream, please increase the amount a little or the truffles may come out too hard I changed the photo for this recipe (this photo shows some slightly thinner truffles). If you use the amounts listed above then you can make some thicker truffles. Please adjust the thickness of the truffles to your taste. I recommend these truffles as presents. You can use milk chocolate instead of dark chocolate if you'd prefer. A mix of dark and milk chocolate is also delicious..\", 'dish name: Roast Chicken With Stuffing.\\nIngredients: 1 (4 lb) roasting chickens,1 (6 ounce) box Stove Top stuffing mix,1 12 cups water,14 cup butter, melted, for stuffing,14 teaspoon salt,18 teaspoon pepper,12 cup butter, melted, for chicken,1 (10 ounce) can chicken broth.\\nInstructions: Mix stuffing mix with water and 1/4 c melted butter in microwavable bowl; cover.

Add 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, uncovered, until the chicken is cooked through, about 15 minutes. Remove the chicken from the saucepan and let cool completely.

Stir in the cilantro, parsley, jalapeno, and garlic. Add the chicken, red pepper, red onion, and scallion and mix together. Season with salt and pepper. Taste and add more vinegar to give the filling a pleasant, but not sour, tang. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve. 3 To make the arepas, stir 3 cups lukewarm water and the salt together in a large bowl to dissolve the salt. Gradually add 3 cups cornmeal, mixing with your fingers to dissolve any lumps, adding enough to make a soft dough that holds its shape without cracking when molded. Set dough aside to rest for 3 minutes. Add the oil and work it in with your hands, adding cornmeal or water to return the dough to the proper consistency. 4 Divide the dough into 6 equal portions. Shape each into a 4-inch diameter disk, about 1 inch thick. Transfer to a baking sheet. 5 Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 350F. Lightly oil a large nonstick skillet or griddle and heat over medium heat. 6 In batches, place the arepas in the skillet. Cook until the underside is a splotchy golden brown, about 4 minutes.

Size) Crab,1 whole Ripe Avocado, Peeled, Pitted And Cut In Strips,3 whole Small Carrots, Shredded,1 Tablespoon Rice Vinegar,1 teaspoon Fresh Ginger, Grated.\\nInstructions: Rinse the rice before cooking it. It seems to help it develop the sticky factor you need. Cook the rice according to package directions (youll need 4 cups of cooked rice for the recipe). While the rice is cooking, you can toast the sesame seeds and make the carrot pickle. Grate the carrots, as fine as you can, place them in a bowl and add 1 tablespoon rice vinegar and then grate 1 teaspoon of fresh ginger over the carrots. Toss and set aside to pickle. You can add more rice vinegar if you like as well as more ginger. I keep a ginger root in my freezer and then I can just use my microplane to grate as much as I need for a recipe, since ginger isnt something I use that often. Take out how many of the sheets of Nori you are going to use. For this recipe I use 4 or 5 sheets, depending on how generous I am with the rice. Dissolve the sugar in the rice vinegar. Set aside. Cut the cucumber if you decide to use it as well as the spring onion (green onion). Drain the can of crab, and set aside. Set out your bamboo mat if you have one, cover it with some plastic wrap. After the rice has cooked, place it into a large shallow bowl, and sprinkle the rice vinegar/sugar over the top of the rice. Very important, do not stir the rice after adding the rice vinegar/sugar mixture. Cut and fold it as if you were adding flour to egg whites. You dont want to mash the rice, just make sure the rice vinegar is incorporated into the rice. Use the bamboo paddle or a large flat wooden spoon and make sure that the shallow bowl you put the cooked rice in is big enough that you can do the cut and fold without doing a rice mash. Its best to do this while the rice is still warm as it absorbs the vinegar best this way. Cut the avocado into slices at this point and place aside. I cut the avocado in half, twist it a little and pop it apart. Then I use a thin paring knife, and slice lengthwise into the avocado, stopping at the skin. Run the thin knife around the edge of the avocado, and just pop out the slices. Or slice it however you want. After peeling it, that is. First, place a sheet of plastic wrap on top of the bamboo rolling mat. Sprinkle a thin layer of the toasted sesame seeds on top of the plastic. Then put a thin layer of rice on top. About a half a cup or so. I like a thin layer of rice. Wet your hand and keep a bowl of water beside you. Pat down the rice with your wet hand. Dont mash the rice down, just pat it into place. Its sticky enough that it will do just fine. (This is very important. You need to keep your hands wet, otherwise the rice sticks to everything.) Next place a sheet of Nori on top of the rice and then add your fillings, some avocado and some crab or the spring onions and grated carrot mixture. I usually make 3 California Rolls, and then two of the other kind. I like putting the Nori on the outside of the roll when I fill it with vegetables like the grated carrot, spring onion and cucumber. Roll the sushi roll using the mat and that plastic wrap. Pick up the edge of the wrap thats closest to you, roll away from yourself keeping the wrap firm. Continue until the whole thing is in a nice roll. This does take a little practice and if you screw up the first one, you can always save it and eat it a little later on. Pat the roll and shape it a little so its nice and round. Place in the refrigerator. Continue with the next sheet of Nori, the second roll is a lot easier to do. I can usually get three California Rolls out of one can of crab. Continue using the rest of the rice and Nori. I alternated by putting a sheet of Nori down first, placing a thin layer of rice on that with some of the grated carrot and green spring onions. You can also use matchstick sliced cucumbers if you know your guests can handle the cucumbers. When all the rolls are done, refrigerate them until you are ready to serve. Then take each roll out and slice into thin slices. I find each roll will make about 8 slices. And heres the final hint. Cut each roll in half and then slice each of the halves in half again, and then slice each of those halves in half again. You should have 8 even slices at this point. Serve with some wasabi, soy sauce, sesame seeds and pickled carrots..', 'dish name: Betty Crocker\\'s Baking Powder Biscuits (Light, Flaky and Tender).\\nIngredients: 2 cups all-purpose flour,1 tablespoon granulated sugar,4 teaspoons baking powder,1 teaspoon salt,12 cup shortening,34 cup milk.\\nInstructions: Preheat oven to 450F degrees. Sift flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt together in medium bowl. Cut in shortening using pastry blender (or pulling 2 table knives through ingredients in opposite directions), until mixture looks like fine crumbs. Stir in milk until dough leaves side of bowl (dough will be soft and sticky). Place dough on lightly floured surface. Knead lightly 10 times. Roll or pat 3/4 inch thick. Cut with floured 2 1/2 -inch round cutter. Place on ungreased cooked sheet about 1 inch apart for crusty sides, touching for soft sides (I prefer crusty sides). After cutting as many biscuits as possible, lightly press-dont knead- the scraps of dough together to make 1 to 2 more biscuits. Bake 10 to 12 min or until golden brown. Serve warm. Note: This recipe doubles very well. Every time that I make these, I always double this recipe. To double, simply double all the ingredients. Also, the key to high-rise, flaky biscuits is having really fresh baking powder and not overworking the dough. Even if your baking powder is not expired, the biscuits will not rise if the baking powder has clumps inside the container. Also, I cannot emphasize enough to just lightly knead the dough 10 times; over-kneading will produce a tough biscuit. When you pat the dough to 3/4 inch thickness, the baking powder will already be activating the dough to rise. Do not re-pat the dough down again because the air bubbles forming will make the biscuits flaky. Betty Crocker\\'s Tips for Biscuits: Tip One: One secret to making flaky biscuits is thoroughly blending or \"cutting in\" the shortening and dry ingredients. A pastry blender, which breaks the shortening into little lumps works great for cutting inches If you don\\'t have one, you can crisscross two table knives through the flour and shortening or use a wire whisk. Tip Two: Use a biscuit cutter dipped in flour to cut the dough, pushing the cutter straight down through the dough. If you twist as you cut, the biscuits will be uneven. Cut the biscuits as close together as possible. If you don\\'t have a biscuit cutter, use the end of an open 6-ounce juice can or other narrow can or glass, or use cookie cutters for fun shapes. Dip in flour before cutting..', 'dish name: Fall Fruit Dip.\\nIngredients: 8 ounces cream cheese,7 ounces marshmallow creme.\\nInstructions: Mix well, chill.

If you want, you can blend this in a small food processor or blender, but I actually like a little texture to mine. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use. This can easily be made ahead of time. Burgers -- In a medium size bowl, add the salsa, chili powder, cumin, grated onion (and yes grate the onion right over the bowl, the juice is important), pinch of salt and pepper. If you use a mild salsa you can add a bit more chili powder, but I use a medium heat salsa which works just fine for this. Mix everything well. Then add in the turkey and mix lightly, I prefer to use my hands; and make sure not to over work the burgers. Make 4 nice size burgers and place on a small sheet pan lined with either foil or parchment. Make a small indentation in the center of the burger with your thumb. Not too deep, just a little indent; this helps the burger not to shrink up as it grills. Season with salt and pepper and put in the freezer. We are not freezing them, just firming them up. They cook better after they rest a bit and are chilled. About 15-20 minutes in the freezer. These also can be made a head of time. Garnish -- Prepare your avocado slices and drizzle with the remaining lime juice (just so they doesn't brown), lettuce leaves and cheese. Grill -- I prefer an outside grill, but a inside grill pan or even a heavy saute pan will work just fine. Spray the pan or grill with a non stick spray and cook the burgers on the first side until you get a nice sear and golden brown, depending on how thick you make them, about 5 minutes. Flip, and make sure when you flip, the burger releases from the pan or grill easily. If you have to scrape to flip it, it isn't ready to be flipped. The second side again will take about 5 minutes, maybe a bit less. Add 2 slices of cheese per burger and melt. As the cheese melts, add the burger rolls either to a broiler or grill to lightly brown. Finish -- Top the bottom bun with a thin slather of the mayonnaise, then a lettuce leaf; then the burger with melted cheese, another lettuce leaf, avocado slices and top with the second bun slathered with the mayonnaise. Serve -- ENJOY! A crisp green salad goes great with this; fries of course or chips and a pickle..\", \"dish name: Apple-Raisin Cottage Cheese.\\nIngredients: 1/4 cup applesauce,1/2 cup BREAKSTONE'S or KNUDSEN Cottage Cheese,2 Tbsp. raisins,1/2 tsp. cinnamon sugar.\\nInstructions: Spoon applesauce into serving dish.

Then take them and cut them in half. Then take the halfed potato and cut it longways down the middle. Then begin slicing it along the width into what would look like little triangle shapes into your desired thickness. (NOTE: Remember the thicker than you cut them the longer they will take to cook, but you don't want to cut them so thin that they cook up really crispy like potato chips.) Next begin by cutting the ends of the onion and off. Peel the first layer of the paper like peel/outer-skin off of the onion. Then take the onion and slice it in half width ways. Now with the round side up and the flat portion on your cutting board ,begin cutting at an angle starting from the end into Julienned slices. (NOTE: The thickness should be about an 1/8 of an inch) repeat this step with the other piece of the onion. Heat large deep skillet/ or WOK over medium heat and add/melt half or your butter. Once the butter is melted begin sauteeing your onions. Stir frequently and cook until they are almost fully cooked and a bit translucent. Once they are cooked remove them and place them in a bowl to be used later. If you are handy with a WOK you can use it to flip/stir your onions. Now add the remaining butter to the skillet until melted. Then add in your potatoes ,pepper ,and garlic salt. Stir potatoes frequently/ or if using a WOK flip them frequently! Once the potatoes are pretty tender and almost cooked thoroughly ,take and add in the sauteed onions from the bowl that you cooked earlier. Once the onions are added keep stirring and cook an additional 10 minutes until everything is cooked thoroughly. If you like your potatoes a little crispy you can stop stirring and let the bottoms of the potatoes brown but make sure to be careful not to burn them. The last step is to remove from heat and place on a plate with a paper towel to absorb some of the grease and butter. Once they have cooled a bit and drained you can eat no ketchup needed!
